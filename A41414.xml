            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T might argue I did acquieſce too much to fleſh and bloud, ſhould I dedicate this book to any of my Kindred: and leaſt it ſeeme preſumption in me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
<pb facs="tcp:204830:4"/> it unto you; I must beſeech you to believe 'tis none of mine: You know I have a gallant Master for this ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, who ſaid, <hi>His Doctrine was not His:</hi> which yet none could lay claime unto beſides his ſacred ſelf. How juſtly then may I profeſſe this book is not mine own? being all of it (upon the matter) either Holy Churches Prayers, or Holy Text, or Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Expoſitions on the ſame? And (as ſuch) it is rather your Defence, than any waies in need of your Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Now least you ſhould reply, I give it then unjuſtly as mine own to you, and more unjuſtly begg your Patronage thereof, as of a ſtollen Treaſure; I must confeſſe it is indeed a pious theft, but ſuch an one, as the thiefe may take at noone day from the Coffers of the
<pb facs="tcp:204830:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> Church without a Sacrifice, without a bluſh, though all the world were lookers on; and ſuch, as you may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both receive, and Patronize, with as ſmall remorſe, as men doe Hony brought unto the Hives, which openly the Bees have ſtollen from the melliflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous flowers of other mens Gardens, as I have done the ſweet Connexion that I found between the Churches Prayers, and Text of Holy Writ; when I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay to ſhew the ſelf-ſame Spirit anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates them all, and makes them ſpeak one ſence in diverſe Languages or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects.</p>
            <p>And this ſympathy between the parts of Holy Churches ſervice is what I here preſent to you, as my obſervation, rather than my worke, for had it not been there before, I could not now
<pb facs="tcp:204830:5"/> have found it out, if yet I may not rather feare I looſe it, when I look to find it, by making it appeare leſſe than it is, for want of being able to ſhew it to the full. But I will not tell you by how many titles I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title this to you, leaſt I force the Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes of your modeſtie, to change com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion with the Roſes of your other Virtues, or leaſt I ſeeme to flatter you, who are not to be flattered: and therefore I ſhall rather ſilence my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to you, than betray the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of your bounties, which your left cannot accuſe your right hand of, although they both are ſtealing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whilſt they give their Almes in ample manner, unknown to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he well adviſed, who knew the beſt way how to make benevolences
<pb facs="tcp:204830:5"/> meritorious; nor ſhall I boast your more than ordinary favours ſhowred upon me other waies, as tyes to make me give you theſe my labours: ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting therefore from all ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and looking onely on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this booke, I find not any man more fit to Patronize it, than your ſelfe, becauſe as it aſſociates all the <hi>CHRISTIANS</hi> of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe into one <hi>SODALITIE,</hi> ſo you, that are Eminent in making every man your owne, will be the greateſt help to this Aſſociation, which I have founded on the Word of God, and Prayers of Holy Church; two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that I know not any one more verſed in than you, witneſſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſtore of both, which your <hi>Miſsive</hi> and your <hi>Miſſcelania</hi> doe afford;
<pb facs="tcp:204830:6"/> wherein you ſhew your ſelfe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have the Scripture lodg'd within your heart, but even the genuine ſenſe thereof ingrafted in your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as appears by your admirable Explications of the Texts, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of them to the purpoſe that you cite them for, which as it was a motive for me to imitate you in, ſo in juſtice it obligeth me to conſecrate this book to you, whoſe whole deſigne is either Notion, or the uſe of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Text.</p>
            <p>Againe, Sir, I looke upon you as a man deſigned to ſome thing more than yet the World is privie to, for your <hi>Pauline</hi> Converſion, makes me think you are <hi>the Veſſell of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which our Nation may one day hope to ſee, as overflowing as I know
<pb facs="tcp:204830:6"/> you are now full of Eminent Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this I profeſſe I doe not mind you of, to puffe you up with ſelf-conceit, (for of your ſelf it is with you as with the reſt of men, made up of nothing but corruption and infirmity) but to humble you rather, to ſee how much of Grace doth ſhine upon the dunghill of Humane Nature, while your Converſion from infidelity workes in you an averſion from all ſingularity, and renders you a man partiall to none, beneficiall to all that know you, even unto thoſe that are above you to, who fare the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for your virtues, while their Temporalls are raiſed from the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall foundations you have laid. Thus from the Court unto the Cart, from the Prince unto, the Begger God
<pb facs="tcp:204830:7"/> hath adapted you to all his Holy Ends; and therefore I that aime at <hi>Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity</hi> in this <hi>Sodality,</hi> at <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in our <hi>Community,</hi> (let me atteſt for this the Motto of my Book <hi>Saint Pauls</hi> words to the <hi>Romanes, CHAP. 15.

                  <head>THE Key of the work, BY WAY OF PREFACE. TO ALL CHRISTIAN READERS.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I firſt thought of writing for the Preſs, I was over-preſt with a multitude of difficulties, as well about the Subject, as about the Method; and I could never be perſwaded to ſet Pen to Paper, before I had armed my ſelf againſt the common obſtacle in all Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wayes, <hi>That Books have their Fates from the Capacities of their Readers.</hi> For I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 'twas a labour loſt to Write, and to be
<pb facs="tcp:204830:13"/> laid aſide, as either not underſtood, or not pleaſing to the Reader. So I reſolved either to Write what might call the Reader aſide, to make him underſtand himſelf, as well as me, or elſe to ſpare my own labour of writing. And becauſe I knew no Subject had power enough to command the Reader, but that which was of Divine Authority, therefore I made choice of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> and of the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Prayers</hi> to write upon: And finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo common over all the world, as a little Book, conſiſting of theſe two ſubjects, called the <hi>Primmer,</hi> as being the <hi>Prime,</hi> the <hi>firſt,</hi> or <hi>Principle office of a Lay-Chriſtian:</hi> whereby he makes a demonſtration of his dayly bounden duty towards Almighty God, in that little abſtract of the <hi>Breviary,</hi> which is the Prieſt his larger <hi>Office:</hi> I conceived nothing ſo worthy of my paines, as to render that little Book intelligible, ſweet, and eaſie to the People, which I perceived was rather ſaid by rote, than underſtood: Not that I believe this Primmer was publiſhed at firſt by holy Churches Order, without a better Gloſs than I can hope to make upon it now, but that I conceive devouring time hath eaten out a world of Pious Works, that were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Primitive Church, and amongſt the reſt, ſome expoſition of the <hi>Primmer</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:204830:13"/> made, or by word of mouth from the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in their Sermons, or in their private exhortations by way of Catechiſme, or elſe expounded in ſome book on purpoſe, written to that end, as I write this. For I cannot think our Pious, and our Prudent Mother, holy Church, would iſſue out a book of day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duty, as far above the peoples reach, as Heaven is from Earth, unleſſe the <hi>Antiphons, Verſicles, Reſponſories, Prayers, Hymnes, Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> and <hi>Pſalmes</hi> thereof, were made ſome way or other intelligible to the common world thus bid to pray.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore now I found no expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Primmer</hi> extant, and yet encounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Book in every bodies Pocket, in many mens Hands, in moſt mens Mouths, that underſtood not what they ſaid, in ſaying it, and thence grew bold to undervalue it, to call it dry and barren Prayer, in reſpect of other Books, (eſpecially the Manuell) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting indeed of many Prayers derived from the <hi>Primmer,</hi> but more abounding with a greater number made by private perſons, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough, no doubt, yet not of ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed authority, as thoſe who made the <hi>Primmer</hi> Prayers. Hence it was I thought no ſubject fitter to be written on, than that which ſhould at once expound the holy
<pb facs="tcp:204830:14"/> Writ, and Churches Prayers, with all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts thereof contained in the <hi>Primmer,</hi> both being ſo profound, and ſo myſterious as they are.</p>
                  <p>Know therefore, Chriſtian Reader, firſt, The <hi>Antiphons</hi> are ever ſuch, as have report unto the preſent time, or ſeaſon of the year they are made proper to by holy Church: Know ſecondly, they ever are ſome part of holy Writ, appointed by the like Authority; or for Epiſtle, or for Goſpell of the Day: Yet to know this is not enough, unleſſe you further know the meaning of the word it ſelf, that an <hi>Antiphon</hi> imports as much as a pre-toning of a Tune to follow, not unlike the Birds <hi>recording</hi> in the winter time, the tunes they chirp, and ſing aloud in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to the praiſe of their Creator.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is the <hi>Choriſts,</hi> or maſters of the Quire, where holy Office is ever ſung in open Churches, that allow this happy liberty, come up unto the <hi>Canon,</hi> who begins the Pſalme, and in a low Tone give the Tune to him, who takes it thus, then ſings aloud, and leads the Quire after him all ſinging out the Pſalme in loudeſt voice, which was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphonized</hi> as above, pre-toned I mean, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, or pre-tuned by the <hi>Choriſts</hi> firſt of all.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:204830:14"/>
                  <p>Now that you ſee theſe <hi>Antiphons</hi> end here with a <hi>Verſicle,</hi> and <hi>Reſponſory</hi> (as they doe in every <hi>Primmer</hi>) this argues all the Prayers, and other parts of holy Churches Service that doe follow, are exerciſes as well of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly, as of Love Divine, and that no jar ought to intercede in tempo all affaires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe who are tyed up to a harmony, and concordancy in the ſpirituall duty of good Chriſtians, whilſt we muſt be ever ready to anſwer with a <hi>Reſponſory,</hi> him that begins with a <hi>Verſicle</hi> to incite us to priaſe Almighty God, and to give a teſtimony we are at peace with one another, before we dare preſume to make our joynt petition to the Heavenly Majeſty for our own, and our neighbours neceſſities in the following <hi>Prayer:</hi> But of this more anon, when we ſhall ſay who firſt prefixt the <hi>Antiphons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pſalmes and Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Pleaſe, gentle Reader, onely here to know, that hence it was I took the Riſe of writing in the Method I obſerve throughout this Book: For ſince I found the ſelf-ſame <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons</hi> that here you have in Engliſh to be in all the <hi>Primmers</hi> of the world, in all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall languages that ſay this holy Office every day, even in the <hi>Breviaries</hi> of the Prieſts, I did conclude thoſe <hi>Antiphons</hi> were as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonings
<pb facs="tcp:204830:15"/> to the tune of the Myſticall muſick of the holy Church that was to follow, then, when ſuch an <hi>Antiphon</hi> was read, or to ſpeak more plainly, theſe <hi>Antiphons</hi> did ſeeme to point out what the <hi>Duty</hi> was that then we ſhould be at. Namely, that all the Children of the Church ſhould put in execution the practice of that Doctrine, which the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher then delivered in the Pulpits, when, or that <hi>Antiphon,</hi> or elſe ſome other part of holy Writ, in that dayes ſervice, was the Preachers Text.</p>
                  <p>And that we might doe this the better, we thought the following <hi>Prayer</hi> was fitly given to petition grace to doe it: Hence I inferred thoſe <hi>Prayers</hi> muſt needs extend to more than yet the word <hi>Collecta,</hi> or <hi>Collect,</hi> did import; for that betokens onely the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the peoples ſuffrages put into the mouth of the officiating Prieſt, in his own, and their behalfs, and begging Grace, that what the Preachers tell them is their preſent duty, they may execute Religiouſly.</p>
                  <p>But further yet, we thought this <hi>Prayer,</hi> this <hi>Collect</hi> (following ſuch an <hi>Antiphon,</hi> and being the open muſick which every Chriſtian was to make that day in the ears of the Heavenly Majeſty, while their hearts were to ſing what their lips did ſay) muſt alſo keep
<pb facs="tcp:204830:15"/> the Tune of that <hi>Antiphon;</hi> ſpeak I mean to God, in the ſame ſenſe, and be as an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, or Abſtract of the holy Text, from whence that <hi>Antiphon</hi> was taken; muſt be in fine a kind of ſumme, or Quinteſſence of all the Preaching parts of that dayes Service, and muſt from thence aſſume the name of Collect, as if collecting up in few lines the larger Leſſons of the holy Text, both in the Epiſtle and Goſpel of that day. This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſeemed hugely conſonant to reaſon, and if it could be made appear, would render ſure the <hi>Prayers</hi> of holy Church extreamly proper to the Times and Dayes they were appointed for, extreamly reverential, &amp; extreamly grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the People. To ſee thereby the ſweet connexion in all the parts of holy Churches Service. This, this Beloved, is the hard attempt of all the following Book, wherein how happy I ſhall be, I know not yet, before I hear you ſay, you ſee it is in ſome proportion done. By the <hi>Illuſtrations of the Prayers;</hi> ſhewing how they allude unto (how they exhauſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) the holy Texts both of the Epiſtle, and Goſpell of the Day. By the <hi>Explications</hi> of the Sacred Texts ſhewing how piouſly ſafe they are, when rightly underſtood, how dangerous when heretically wreſted to a contrary ſenſe than in themſelves they bear.
<pb facs="tcp:204830:16"/> And by the <hi>Applications,</hi> not onely ſhewing us how to apply the whole Service of the day to our inſtructions; but how to apply indeed our ſelves to God, by a godlineſſe of life made ſweet and eaſie to us by the ſaid <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now becauſe this ſweet connexion of Parts in holy Service, is a Jewell rendring the Church extreamly Beautifull in the ſight of her ſacred Spouſe, even raviſhing the eyes of Men and Angels; therefore I ſhall deſire the Reader not to huddle ore this Book, as read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for Recreation, but purely for Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which yet will recreate the more, by how much the leſſe thereof is read at once: by how much the oftner the Reader turnes to ſee, and to compare the Parts reporting unto one another, which generally they doe, when in the Print you ſee the letter to vary, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to change, for ever then, the changed letter in the <hi>Gloſſe</hi> is part of either <hi>Prayer,</hi> or holy Text, to which it doth report, and whereunto the Reader ſhall doe well to turn, before he doe proceed to further Lecture, that ſo comparing one place to another, he may ſee the ſimpathy between the parts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; and ſeeing this may praiſe Almighty God in the beauty of his beautifull Spouſe, the holy Church, whoſe very daily ſervice is a kind
<pb facs="tcp:204830:16"/> of picture of her lovelineſſe in the ſight of his Heavenly Majeſty. I doe not undertake to ſay that all the Churches <hi>Prayers</hi> are of ſo deep a ſenſe, as to exhauſt the Epiſtles and Goſpels of that day, whereon they are appointed to be ſaid; but this I doe infer to be avouchable of that peculiar <hi>Prayer</hi> which here is ſet immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the <hi>Antiphon, Reſponſory,</hi> and <hi>Verſicle</hi> of each reſpective Sunday, which is ever the firſt <hi>Prayer</hi> in the Divine Service; and which the Prieſt doth alwayes ſay with an addreſſe unto the People, turning about to them, and ſaying, <hi>Dominus vobiſcum, Our Lord be with you,</hi> (meaning in your hearts) that there you may ſing forth his Praiſes which my lips are now going to pronounce in your names, and in your behalfs.</p>
                  <p>True it is, I have at the end of every part of this firſt Tome, ſet out a <hi>Trinity of Prayers</hi> appropriated each to their reſpective dayes, which I adviſe all thoſe of this <hi>Sodality</hi> to ſay three times a day, morning, noon, and night: whereof this <hi>Prayer</hi> we call the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> (for the Reaſons above) is the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, that <hi>Prayer</hi> which is called the <hi>Secret,</hi> being the very ſame the Prieſt then ſayes, when he hath turned himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the People, ſaying, <hi>Orate Fratres, &amp;c. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Pray that my Sacrifice, and yours, may
<pb facs="tcp:204830:17"/> bee acceptable to God the Father Almighty.</hi> And this he doth immediatly after he hath made the <hi>Oblation</hi> or <hi>Offertory</hi> of the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> which he is preſently to conſecrate into the body and bloud of Chriſt, as his own and the peoples <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> Not that it is therefore called the <hi>Secret,</hi> becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould not be privie to it, being (as they are) remarkably concerned therein, but that it repreſents the nature of our offerings to God, to be rather hearty, than heard of; rather private, then publike, (ſo far forth as they are ours) though 'tis moſt true that (as the Prieſts) they are to be made in open Churches upon open Altars; yet with this reſpect, that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſhall convey them to the heavenly Majeſty, rather than noiſe, and ſo the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that offers them, is (for this reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others) ſaid ſoftly by the Prieſt, and thence is called the <hi>ſecret:</hi> Whereas the Collects they are ſaid aloud.</p>
                  <p>And however true it be, that in the old Law, the Prieſt went out of the Peoples ſight from the <hi>ſanctum</hi> (or <hi>Holy</hi>) into the <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum,</hi> (the <hi>holy of holieſt</hi>) for the Reaſons alledged in the Expoſition of the two firſt Verſes on the Epiſtle upon Paſſion Sunday, in the ſecond part of this Firſt Tome, yet in the new Law (which did abrogate the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb facs="tcp:204830:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the old) Holy Church hath held it ſufficient to maintain the Analogie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſacrifices of both the Laws, that the Prieſts of the new (remaining ſtill in the ſight of the People) ſhall go at leaſt out of their hearing, by ſaying ſome Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>ſecretly</hi> (though ſtill in the Peoples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half) as if they were compoſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between grace and nature, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diating between God and his ſinfull crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by way of <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all mediations imaginable. And hence it is to let the People know at leaſt this <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> Prayer is ſaid in their names by the Prieſt (in teſtimony of their offering up both by, and with him, the preſent <hi>ſacrifice</hi>) that I adviſe them joyntly with the Prieſt to ſay the ſelf-ſame <hi>ſecret</hi> to the ſelf-ſame end, that <hi>prayer</hi> importing over an actuall <hi>oblation</hi> or <hi>offering</hi> to God.</p>
                  <p>The third Prayer which is called the <hi>Poſt-Communion,</hi> I therefore alſo publiſh here in the end of this Book, becauſe it imports the peoples thanks-giving after the <hi>Communion,</hi> thereby to ſhew, that whereas then the Prieſt hath received actually (in his own and their behalf) ſo they have alſo received in Vote, in wiſh, or deſire, that they were alſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to have actually received, and this being
<pb facs="tcp:204830:18"/> a ſpirituall <hi>communion</hi> at the leaſt, I deſire all the devotes of our <hi>ſodality</hi> in thanks thereof, to ſay this third prayer alſo with the Prieſt, becauſe immediatly before his ſaying it, hee turns about, and makes his application to the people, as above; by <hi>Dominus vobiſcum (Our Lord be with you.</hi>) And thus it is evident, theſe Prayers are very proper for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which are never ſaid by the Prieſt, but with addreſſe to them.</p>
                  <p>Now if any ask the Reaſon why I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this <hi>Trinity of Prayers</hi> to be ſaid by our Sodality three times a day, truly 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> being a ſervice to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity, wherein God is acknowledged to have the ſole command of life and death in his creatures, therefore in honour of the three ſacred Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinitie, I recommend this triple Repetition of this <hi>Trinity of Prayers,</hi> as alſo further, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our ſodality may partake of all the <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> which are daily made throughout the world, not but that the morning is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time of this Homage, but becauſe 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver day in ſome part of the earth, when 'tis night with another, and ſo by our ſaying theſe Prayers even at night, we joyn in <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to God with thoſe who ſay the ſame prayers at the ſelf-ſame time by day.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:204830:18"/>
                  <p>I could animate our Sodality farther yet to this Devotion, by telling them what indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences they may gain by this, (not that theſe are purchaſed by money, as is objected by our adverſaries but given <hi>gratis</hi>) namely, 15. dayes Pardon from <hi>Purgatory</hi> paines for every time they ſay any one of the Churches <hi>Prayers,</hi> thoſe I mean that are with publick authority avowed by our holy Mother (to ſay nothing now of fifty dayes indulgence, for every time they ſay their <hi>Primmer</hi> office, which is not granted to their Manuall Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) but I ſuffice my ſelf with this, that 'tis the beſt of all Devotions in the world, to praiſe the Bleſſed Trinity, and even thoſe that love to pray to Saints, muſt know, they do it beſt while with their holy Patrons they adore the Univerſall Patron of all the Saints, <hi>The ſacred, and undivided Trinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, in ſaying this <hi>Trinity of Prayers,</hi> they doe not onely joyntly pray with the viſible, but alſo with the inviſible Prieſt, our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who even now in Heaven dayly ſays the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame Prayers, as often as the Prieſt officiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſayes them here on Earth; becauſe our Prieſts are but the Inſtrumentall Miniſters of Sacrifice, the Principall is our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; who in memory of his once
<pb facs="tcp:204830:19"/> Bloudy Sacrifice, offers up dayly an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy one, unto his Heavenly Father, and ſo makes that to be (with God) a <hi>Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (in a Myſticall way) of his bitter Death and Paſſion, which is (with us) a dayly <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration</hi> thereof; for which purpoſe ſee the <hi>Secret,</hi> on the ninth Sunday after Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, in the book of Prayers below.</p>
                  <p>See further, <hi>Molina,</hi> in his Golden work of <hi>Prieſt-hood,</hi> where he cites a Torrent of Fathers, to avow this verity. And for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowment of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Vocally Praying,</hi> even in Heaven for us, (by way, at leaſt of <hi>claiming</hi> what he hath already <hi>merited</hi> in our behalfs.) See <hi>Cornelius a Lapide</hi> upon Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. ver. 34. who backs himſelf in this with a mighty authority of Fathers: ſo 'tis no weak aſſertion, I hope, of mine, nor any ill-grounded recommends, being thus ſupported.</p>
                  <p>O Beloved, what an ineffable dignity doth this ſet upon theſe <hi>Prayers?</hi> What an Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument may we bring to our ſelves by ſaying them in ſuch ſociety? What a vaſt Treaſure of devotion ſhall we find wrapt up in them? In fine, what a ſupine negligence ſhall it be in us not to avail our ſelves of this devotion? which (without envie) I may ſay is ſuch, as none (that is vocall) can equall it, and
<pb facs="tcp:204830:19"/> which yet I have aymed to contrive into ſo ſhort a method, as ſhall not hinder us from any other pious exerciſes whatſoever, onely let me beg this favour of our Sodality to ranke this way of prayer in the number of thoſe duties towards Almighty God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is truly ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. ver. 23. <hi>Haec opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet facere: Theſe things we ought to doe:</hi> which yet ſhall nothing claſh with what followes truly averrable of other Devotions to, <hi>Et illa non omittere, Thoſe we need not omit,</hi> for uſing theſe. Not that I affirm we muſt of neceſſity ſay this Trinity of Prayer which here I have ſuggeſted, (to deſerve the Title of good Chriſtians; <hi>or of Trinitarians,</hi> as ſome from hence may call us) but that I mean we muſt prefer the <hi>publike prayers</hi> of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church, before all others whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And truly ſince the firſt of theſe three <hi>Prayers</hi> will by this Book, appear to bee an Abſtract both of the Epiſtle and Goſpel of the day, rather than I ſhall attribute this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to my own <hi>Invention;</hi> I will conceive it was the priſtine practice of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the very nature of the Piety is ſuch, as ſeems to draw its ſource from the better foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of devotion, than any I can lay claim unto, namely the zeals of the Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church: True it is, I can not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
<pb facs="tcp:204830:20"/> ſay it was ſo, but thus much I need not ſcruple to avouch, That as the Epiſtles and Goſpels are the expreſſe Doctrine of our bleſſed Saviour (or of his Apoſtles, as where S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Non Dominus, ſed ego, Not our Lord, but I,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 7. (ſo the Churches <hi>publike Prayers,</hi> are the ſpeciall <hi>Dictates</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, that is to ſay, <hi>the avowed ſuggeſtions</hi> of that Holy Spirit, (which avowment our <hi>private praiers</hi> do want) though whether the <hi>bleſſed ſpirit</hi> were reſolv'd, The holy Fathers (who made theſe <hi>Publick Prayers</hi>) ſhould (with reflection) frame them ſuiteable to this <hi>Deſigne</hi> which I now draw them to, that is, more than I dare venture to affirme: but certainly that holy Spirit did ſuggeſt unto the Paſtors of the Church a ſtile ſo proper, and ſo deep withall, as might ſound the loweſt bottome of the Sea of holy Writ, and ſo exhauſt even the abſtruſeſt ſence thereof; which whether I have alwayes done I know not, but I beleive, the meaneſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding will perceive, I often make the <hi>Collect</hi> expreſſe the ſubſtance of the whole Epiſtle and Goſpel of the day, and where I come not home to this, 'tis rather that I ſee it not, than that the <hi>Prayer</hi> extends no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or ſuits no better unto this <hi>Deſign;</hi> ſuffice it now the door is open, that ſtronger-ſighted
<pb facs="tcp:204830:20"/> ſoules may ſee much farther into the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of this <hi>Devotion</hi> than I have done, and ſhew the world much rarer fruit therein. To me the Honour is too much, that I have made a great Attempt, which is to render that Book ſweet and eaſie, wherein we may preſume, the Holy Ghoſt directed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of it, for the publick uſe of the Layety: the <hi>Primmer</hi> I mean, whoſe <hi>Prayers,</hi> I hope, henceforward will be found, as ſweet as they are ſound, and not ſo hard, as to be laid aſide, for either barren, or too deep to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the common People.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hymmes</hi> whereof, I conceive, are lately made ſo ſmooth, ſo eloquent, and yet ſo eaſie too, (in the <hi>Manuell</hi> lately printed at Saint <hi>Omers</hi>) that every one, who can but read the Engliſh Tongue, will find them very pleaſing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Leſſons</hi> I ſhall explicate in my ſecond Tome of this <hi>Chriſtian Sodality,</hi> (which I intend to Publiſh next, following the like method as here I hold in this) upon all the Feaſts of our Lord, as alſo upon thoſe Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of his ever Bleſſed Mother the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (thoſe eſpecially which allude to any Myſtery of our Redemption.) As to the particular Feaſts of other Saints, I ſhall ſpare the labour to write upon them in this
<pb facs="tcp:204830:21"/> method, but ſhall recommend them for daily Garniſhing, or Sawces, to the Diſhes, added now and then (as they occurre) to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Table of the Churches Sundayes and weekly food, out of the Epiſtles and Goſpels of the Seaſon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the <hi>Prayers</hi> we uſe to Saints are cheifly addreſt to God, by the merits of his ſacred Son, as in the cloſe of every Prayer appeares, ending ſtill, <hi>Through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe the particular honour we give to Saints, muſt never interrupt the generall duty we owe to God, at all times, and upon all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe I find theſe <hi>Prayers</hi> have rather a Report to the <hi>Martyrologe</hi> (or Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Saints lives and deaths) than to the Epiſtle and Goſpel of the day, in regard one and the ſame Epiſtle and Goſpel is common to divers Saints; yet we may piouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive thoſe Saints (whom then we ſerve) have ſerved God in their life time, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>eminent</hi> in ſuch perfections as the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Goſpels, read upon their Feaſts, doe recommend unto us all. Nevertheleſſe, I ſhall, in my ſecond Tome, ſet out the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints,</hi> in ſuch order, as I intend to doe the Feaſts of our Lord, and of his ſacred
<pb facs="tcp:204830:21"/> Mother, that by this meanes the Layety may ſee (in generall at leaſt) the ſeverall Degrees of Saintity in Holy Church, as thoſe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, Virgins,</hi> and <hi>Widdowes;</hi> whence they may eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the particular Proportion of every particular Saint (as his or her Feaſt occurres) in that line of Perfection which the <hi>common Glaſſe</hi> of Saintity ſhall repreſent.</p>
                  <p>As for the like regard, I intend laſtly in my ſecond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome to add the <hi>Communion of Vigils,</hi> the <hi>Embers,</hi> and <hi>Rogation Dayes,</hi> in this ſelf-ſame method as theſe above, becauſe my third <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ome elſe of <hi>Lent,</hi> will be too long, if ſet forth after this manner, there being ſix and thirty <hi>feriall Dayes</hi> in <hi>Lent,</hi> beſides the Sundayes, already publiſhed in this firſt Tome: and every day hath as well a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Antiphon and Prayer, as a particular Epiſtle and Goſpel, proper to it ſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of divers are very long, beſides thoſe four long Goſpels of the <hi>four Evangeliſts,</hi> read all at length in <hi>Holy week,</hi> which will ſwell this third Tome to a mighty bulk, being done in this method, where every verſe is particularly gloſs'd, and by this meanes, I ſhall render as much Scripture eaſie to the people, as will occurre in the flux of the whole year, which is the cheifeſt motive I
<pb facs="tcp:204830:22"/> have to give my ſelf the labour of this laſt laborious Tome; and but for this, I had indeed ſpar'd my pains therein, the rather, becauſe there are already extant admirable <hi>Entertainments for Lent,</hi> excellently well writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Father Cauſin,</hi> and rarely well tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by <hi>Sir Bazill Brook,</hi> into our mother Tongue, which I doe heartily recommend to thoſe of this <hi>Sodality,</hi> as well for ever, as untill my third Tome ſhall come out, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the method of this now publiſhed already: whereunto I have here prefixed a larger <hi>Preface</hi> than ordinary, becauſe I will excuſe the labour of any other <hi>Preface</hi> to the following Tomes.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Pſalms</hi> (which are indeed the hardeſt part of all the <hi>Primmer</hi>) I hope the <hi>Table,</hi> that I ſhall adjoyn to the end of this <hi>Preface,</hi> will prove a <hi>Key</hi> to open every Lock of this our <hi>Davids Pſalter,</hi> and to make us thus farre, at leaſt, to underſtand the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> as to know the Royall Prophets <hi>Drift</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; for as Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> well obſerves in the latter end of his <hi>Prologue</hi> to his Expoſition upon the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> that Book is like a City, ful of ſtately Buildings, divided each into their ſeveral partiments, to which doe open Doors diſtinct, and every Door ſtill opened by a ſpeciall <hi>Key</hi> peculiar to it ſelf; (hear, to this
<pb facs="tcp:204830:22"/> purpoſe, this reverend Fathers words, as you have heard his ſence.) <hi>We muſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>uſe a diligent and deliberate judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Expoſition of every</hi> Pſalm, <hi>that we may know by what</hi> Key <hi>to open the genuine ſence thereof.</hi> Now the learned Preiſts of our Nation, who have tranſlated the whole Bible into Engliſh (fixt on this authority of Saint <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi>) having undertaken to aſſign to every <hi>Pſalm</hi> its proper <hi>Key,</hi> I ſhall adviſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes of this <hi>Sodality,</hi> to take ſpeciall notice of thoſe <hi>Keyes;</hi> and if upon this ſuggeſtion they doe not cauſe their <hi>Primmers</hi> to be printed with ſome mark of ſuch a <hi>Key,</hi> as thoſe Prieſts above have aſſigned proper for every <hi>Pſalm;</hi> at leaſt, I ſhall wiſh them to get ſome charitable freind with a Pen, to mark their Books with ſome one of theſe <hi>Keyes</hi> (which are but Ten in all) alluding to the <hi>Ten-ſtring'd Harp</hi> of holy <hi>David,</hi> and for their more eaſie doing this (as alſo that their Books may not be blemiſhed with the mark) theſe following figures; 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. may ſuffice to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <hi>Keyes</hi> aforeſaid; ſo that as ſoon as e're the eye perceives the <hi>Figure</hi> o're the
<pb facs="tcp:204830:23"/> 
                     <hi>Pſamle,</hi> the underſtanding knowes to which of the <hi>Davidike Keyes</hi> that <hi>Pſalme</hi> was ſet.</p>
                  <p>And conſequently, if the mind be fixt in praiſing God according to the ſenſe of ſuch a <hi>Key,</hi> although ſome of the words do ſurpaſs the underſtanding of the Readers, yet they ſhall finde their Souls delighted to be praiſing God in that ſame ſenſe which <hi>David</hi> made that <hi>Pſalme</hi> to praiſe him in, and where the Verſes now and then may vary from that ſenſe, yet they will ever fall into ſome other of the <hi>Nine,</hi> ſo this varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be as little diſtraction to Souls praying thus, as in <hi>Cromatick Ayres,</hi> a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> (neatly taken) is from ſpoiling of the <hi>Muſick,</hi> which indeed it betters by that <hi>Art,</hi> when flats and ſharps are finely woven in a ſong, and taken ſweetly up from one another.</p>
                  <p>This I ſpeak from my own experience, as well as that of others (even Religious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) who have found exceeding comfort by this means, when I have told them how to ſay their <hi>Latine Office</hi> with Devotion, though they did not underſtand the language; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by help of ſuch a <hi>Figure,</hi> which I markt their Books with, they lifted up their Hearts to God and praiſed his Heavenly Majeſty,
<pb facs="tcp:204830:23"/> in the very proper ſenſe of <hi>David</hi> all the while they ſung their <hi>Office</hi> in the Quire. So that I doe not venture to ſuggeſt a doubtfull thing in this particular, becauſe I have had experience of it in many, who at firſt hearing thought it a thing incredible.</p>
                  <p>Now having thus proſecuted in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the Method of this preſent Tome, and told the whole deſigne of both the other two that are to come, wherein all the parts of the <hi>Primmer</hi> will be rendred eaſie to the People. I doe not doubt but I ſhall quickly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this <hi>Primmer</hi> will from henceforth be eſteemed a very <hi>Paradiſe of Prayers;</hi> of beſt, moſt ſollid, and moſt ſweet Devotion, and by being dayly ſaid, will render us a <hi>Sodality</hi> of underſtanding Saints, united as well in Hearts-affections, as in Voice and <hi>Prayer;</hi> whileſt the Lay-people reading their <hi>Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> read the beſt Praying part of all the holy <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and ſervice of the Day. And in ſo Praying (as this <hi>Chriſtian Sodality</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) is ſupplyed the want of Preaching too, becauſe in theſe ſhort <hi>Prayers</hi> once rightly underſtood, (as by their Gloſſes here they are Illuſtrated) they have as much as all the Paſtors themſelves are able to Preach, while their very <hi>Prayers</hi> abſtract the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of holy Churches Services. Much
<pb facs="tcp:204830:24"/> as your ſpirits doe the ſweetneſs of the Roſe, they are extracted from, and carry it about, as I have aimed to doe the ſenſe of both E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle and Goſpel of the day in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Prayer.</hi> And truly the beſt way I had to ſhew their longer ſenſes were abſtracted into ſhorter <hi>Prayers,</hi> was to ſtrike the ſtone of difficulty which I found therein, upon the harder ſteel of conſtant <hi>Meditation</hi> on that very ſubject, and by this means the <hi>Spirits</hi> of a ſweet <hi>Connexion</hi> iſſued out: ſuch as you ſee like <hi>ſparks of Piety</hi> to run along on that dry <hi>Reed</hi> of <hi>Illuſtration</hi> which I have made by way of <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> upon the <hi>Prayers,</hi> if I call it the looſeſt <hi>Tynder</hi> of diſcourſe, perhaps it is a phraſe of ſtrength enough for that weak ſenſe I write.</p>
                  <p>But leſt I be miſunderſtood, I ſhall adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe here the Chriſtian Reader that I take the latitude of all ſorts of alluſions between the parts of holy Churches ſervices contenting my ſelf to find in any ſenſe a <hi>Sympathy</hi> of <hi>Parts,</hi> be it <hi>Literall, Allegoricall, Morall,</hi> or <hi>Anagogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> which are the four Celebrated Senſes that the <hi>Expoſitours</hi> rely upon in the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Text. The true meaning of which Senſes, are in theſe following Verſes declared,
<q>
                        <pb facs="tcp:204830:24"/>
                        <l>Litera Geſta docet, quid Credas Allegoria,</l>
                        <l>Moralis quid Agas, quo tendas Anagogia.</l>
                     </q> Which is to ſay, the <hi>Literall</hi> Senſe, tells the <hi>Fact</hi> that is paſt; the <hi>Allegoricall,</hi> what we muſt believe, the <hi>Morall</hi> what ought we <hi>to doe;</hi> and the <hi>Anagogicall</hi> to <hi>what end</hi> we doe it; namely, to bring our Souls to Heaven by ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee four ſeverall noted wayes how one ſpeech may allude unto another; how what is <hi>Literally</hi> ſpoke in the Scripture, may be <hi>figuratively</hi> underſtood. Now if I ſhall be obliged further, to recur unto the ſeverall wayes, whereby one thing may be contained in another: for example, <hi>Formally, Virtually,</hi> or <hi>Eminentially,</hi> I hope I ſhall not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed to ſtrain a Senſe too hard, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more common in the Schools. And truly, for compaſſing ſo great (I may mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly ſay ſo rich) a <hi>Deſigne,</hi> I ſee no common Priviledge allowed to others, that can be held too great for me in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. But leſt the common Reader ſhould be loſt in this diſcourſe, that begs a <hi>School-prerogative,</hi> I ſhall crave leave of the more learned, to give unto the leſſe intelligent, examples of thoſe three ſeverall wayes how one thing is <hi>included</hi> in another.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>formally</hi> when the <hi>included</hi> doth deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb facs="tcp:204830:25"/> the <hi>includer.</hi> So we ſay <hi>whiteneſs</hi> is in a wall that is <hi>white,</hi> becauſe <hi>whiteneſs</hi> is the <hi>form</hi> which gives the wall that denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Virtually,</hi> when effects are included in their cauſes, as the Son in his Father, as the greateſt Tree, or faireſt fruit in the little ſeed thereof. <hi>Eminentially,</hi> when the creatures are contained in the Creator, which laſt kind is the moſt excellent way of any thing being contained in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe the creature is more perfect in the Creator, then any <hi>effect</hi> is in the <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cauſe</hi> thereof, or any <hi>form</hi> in the ſubject which it denominates: Or then indeed the creature is in it ſelf, where we find a world of imperfections; though in God there can be none at all: ſo to be <hi>eminentially</hi> contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a thing, is a more noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way of being <hi>included,</hi> then either <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi> or <hi>formally</hi> to be contained is. And thus (now and then) wee ſhall find the <hi>Word of God</hi> to be (as it were) <hi>eminentially</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Churches <hi>prayers,</hi> becauſe in them the Holy Ghoſt ſeems to communicate himſelf, moſt like himſelf, moſt ſpiritually of all, when by the ſpirit of <hi>prayer,</hi> he opens the ſenſe of the letter in the holy Writ: And no marvell ſince our Saviour left his own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Word</hi> to the Expoſition of the Holy
<pb facs="tcp:204830:25"/> Ghoſt, who was ſent on purpoſe <hi>to teach the world</hi> all truth upon all occaſions of debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the meaning of the Text. For as Chriſt is the <hi>word</hi> of his eternall Father; ſo the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the <hi>word of Chriſt;</hi> and ſo the <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of Holy Church, are the <hi>word</hi> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, ſetting an <hi>eminentiall ground</hi> of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious muſick unto the dayly <hi>deſcant</hi> of the Epiſtles and Goſpels of the day; ſince wee ſee the <hi>Antiphons</hi> (commonly taken thence) are ſtill prefixt before the <hi>Prayer,</hi> to ſhew how one reports unto the other.</p>
                  <p>Now if in this Firſt Tome it happens here and there, that ſome one <hi>Sundayes</hi> work bee longer then another, yet there is not any ſo long, which may not with much eaſe bee read in ſeven dayes, and ſtudyed diligently to, thence to make the benefit of reading, by a little <hi>meditation</hi> upon every Verſe. Nor have I ſuffered ſome of thoſe <hi>Sundayes</hi> to paſſe much ſhorter then the reſt, (namely, thoſe in the third Part of this Tome) both becauſe that Part alone, containeth almoſt half the <hi>Sundayes</hi> in the year, as alſo becauſe I did there indeed begin this work in that brief way, which afterwards I did inlarge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was loath to loſe ſo much ſweetneſs of devotion, as the larger Expoſition of the <hi>Text</hi> affords. And if any part ſhall prove
<pb facs="tcp:204830:26"/> leſſe pleaſant then other, let me beſeech the Reader to conſider, That as in Preachers, there are three ſignall Faculties, whereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one renders the owner excellent. Namely, <hi>To teach, To move, To delight.</hi> So it is in Books, for theſe are all well written where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome one at leaſt of thoſe three faculties throughout the Book appears; either that of <hi>teaching</hi> what is true and ſolid Doctrine, That of <hi>moving</hi> to amendment of our lives, or that of <hi>delighting</hi> us with a ſweet delivery of what is written: whether it be by the eloquence of language, or by the quaintneſs of conceit, in which the <hi>Writer</hi> doth expreſſe his mind, it imports not much; and albeit I cannot boaſt of happineſs in any one of theſe three facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet I will hope to have taken ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the contriving of this Book, that what is any where wanting in me, will bee ſupplyed by the Authority of <hi>Texts,</hi> both out of Holy Writ, and out of the Expoſitors upon the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Thus having run over the parts of the <hi>Primmer</hi> whereunto I aim to adopt the whole work of theſe three Tomes intended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; I ſhall now deſire the Reader to take ſuch an account as I am able to give him of the Parts of this my preſent Book, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Antiphons, Verſicles, Reſponſories, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb facs="tcp:204830:26"/> Epiſtles,</hi> and <hi>Goſpels,</hi> as for the <hi>Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>Applications,</hi> (they being wholly mine) the little that is already ſaid thereof above, is more then enough, unleſſe any thing I can doe were more conſiderable. The <hi>Explications</hi> being all of them in ſubſtance (though not in words) the Fathers gloſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the holy Text, have their worth and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in themſelves, more then I can add un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: Onely I deſire the Reader to know, I rather choſe <hi>Cornelius à Lapide,</hi> then any other <hi>Expoſitor,</hi> both becauſe he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten largely upon all the Books of Holy Writ, which do occur in the Churches Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice throughout the year, and becauſe his <hi>Morals</hi> are more for my pious purpoſe, then the other more <hi>literall</hi> Gloſſes would have been, of more ſpeculative Authors; though withall he falls not ſhort of the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe where it is requiſite to follow it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore as to the <hi>Antiphons;</hi> True it is, they are now and then taken from ſome other Part of Holy Writ, then commonly they uſe to be; As for example, That on the firſt Sunday of <hi>Advent,</hi> is out of S. <hi>Luke, Cap,</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 30. whereas the Epiſtle of that dayes ſervice is taken from S. <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 13. And the Goſpel from S. <hi>Luke, cap.</hi> 21. but the reaſon is, that in this <hi>Antiphon</hi> the Church
<pb facs="tcp:204830:27"/> reports to the myſtery of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> which muſt needs precede that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Birth, ſo here reſpect unto the <hi>Time or Seaſon,</hi> hath prevailed for omitting the uſuall way of ordering the <hi>Antiphons</hi> before the <hi>Prayer;</hi> and for the ſame reaſon, the <hi>Anthiphon</hi> alſo on the Third Sunday of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> varies in this manner to, being taken out of Saint <hi>Luke, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 41. whereas the Goſpel on that day, is out of S. <hi>John cap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 19. and ſo the <hi>prayer</hi> is anſwerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: Thus for reſpect unto the Perſons praying in thoſe dayes (as now the Church would have us do). The <hi>Antiphon</hi> on the fourth Sunday of <hi>Advent,</hi> alludes much to the ancient Patriarchs and Prophets man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of calling upon the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, after ſo long an expectation of him, as four thouſand years together; hence that <hi>Antiphon</hi> is then taken as it were out of thoſe ancient Patriarchs mouths, rather then from the Epiſtle or Goſpel of the day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is alwayes one of the <hi>ſeven great Os</hi>, or exclamatory <hi>prayers</hi> of the holy Prophets, groaning and crying out with an impatience of delay in the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (our B. Saviour) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the onely <hi>Three Antiphons</hi> in all the year that are not taken out of the
<pb facs="tcp:204830:27"/> Epiſtles and Goſpels of the Divine Service proper to their day. As for the <hi>Antiphon,</hi> on <hi>Palme Sunday,</hi> though it be not in that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell wihch I have here inſerted in this Book, yet is it out of the true Goſpell of the Day; and the reaſon why I did preſume to alter that dayes Goſpell in this Tome, is becauſe I intend (God willing) to explicate the four long Goſpels of the Paſſion (that are read in <hi>holy Week</hi>) in my third Tome as was ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, in regard they will doe better altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then apart. Beſides, the Goſpell I have here inſerted, though it be not directly upon the Paſſion, (as that of <hi>Palme Sunday</hi> is) yet it reports unto it, and is as it were the very mouth to that Red Sea: ſo not incongruouſly placed here, but ſuiting very well both with the true Epiſtle, and <hi>Prayer</hi> of that day, and is beſides the very Goſpell read in Bleſſing of the <hi>Palmes.</hi> But further (as to this particular of <hi>Antiphons</hi>) the Reader may be pleas'd to underſtand, that many times the words of theſe <hi>Antiphons</hi> are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſenſe of Holy Church, than the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>letter</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> yet ſo, as part (if not all) is ever taken according to the <hi>letter</hi> it ſelf: and again, whereas I cite one verſe onely for ſuch <hi>Antiphons,</hi> as many times runne through ſundry verſes, this is done but for
<pb facs="tcp:204830:28"/> brevity ſake, ſince the diligent Reader will eaſily trace it out in his peruſall of the <hi>Text</hi> it ſelf. Nor muſt our Adverſaries preſume to tax the Church with corruption of the <hi>Text</hi> in ſome of her <hi>Antiphons,</hi> becauſe ſhe doth not alwayes profeſſe, to deliver the ipſiſſime <hi>letter,</hi> but onely the ſence thereof: which is a priviledge, no dutifull Child can deny a pious Mother, who as ſhe is the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> hath abſolute authority, to order the devotion of her Children accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her own pleaſure and piety.</p>
                  <p>True it is, I cannot retrive who ſet the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Antiphons</hi> before the <hi>Prayers,</hi> but this we find in the <hi>Bull of Pius Quintus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Breviaries,</hi> that as the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> referr'd the ordering of the <hi>Breviary</hi> to his ſaid <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> ſo he, conſulting ſome Fathers of that <hi>Councell</hi> (and other the beſt Antiquaries in <hi>Rome</hi>) did let forth the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary</hi> as now we have it, according to the <hi>Records in the Vatican,</hi> containing all the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> for order of the <hi>Publick Prayers,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Antiphons</hi> in the <hi>Primmer</hi> (which are theſe we now treat of) being the ſame with thoſe of the <hi>Breviary,</hi> were undeniably the ſame which now they are. And what ever we may ſay of theſe <hi>Antiphons</hi> in particular,
<pb facs="tcp:204830:28"/> at leaſt we ſhall find Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> (a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Father, and Doctor of the Church) to have been the <hi>Inſtitutor</hi> of that Piety to ſing (in the <hi>Quier</hi>) an <hi>Antiphon</hi> before the beginning of every <hi>Canonicall Hower</hi> in the Prieſt his <hi>Office,</hi> grounded on the <hi>Viſion</hi> which Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> (the third ſucceſſour to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his chair of <hi>Antioch</hi>) had, of <hi>Angels</hi> thus <hi>Antiphoniſing,</hi> and then alternatively ſinging ſweetly one after another, as now the <hi>Divine Office</hi> is ſung in the <hi>Quier,</hi> over all the Catholike Church. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſure the Lay-people have their <hi>Antiphons</hi> out of the Epiſtles and Goſpels, to ſhew their work of <hi>Prayer</hi> which followes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, is grounded on the charity of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in whom they are to Love, to Pray, to doe for each other as they would doe for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And hence we may piouſly preſume the <hi>Verſicle</hi> and <hi>Reſponſory</hi> following every <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> is to incite the <hi>Church Militant,</hi> to anſwer the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>Church Triumphant,</hi> inciting us to <hi>Pray,</hi> and praiſe our Lord with them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially by ſuch a <hi>Prayer,</hi> as doth not onely exhauſt the Epiſtle and Goſpel of the Day, but accompanies withall the <hi>Praying</hi> and the <hi>Preaching</hi> Prieſt amongſt us, the <hi>Angels</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> above us; nay, the <hi>Mediating
<pb facs="tcp:204830:29"/> Jeſus, Praying</hi> then, and thus, to his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father in our behalfs, as was ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch as concernes the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> and <hi>Goſpels</hi> themſelves, I have not dared to alter them in the leaſt tittle, out of a Reverentiall regard unto the Reverend and Learned Tranſlators of the Bible into Engliſh, though in many places, perhaps, if the ſame men were now alive, they would themſelves render the Language (here and there) more gratefull, eſpecially to curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eares, and yet keep as exact a ſenſe of the Learned Languages, of the <hi>Originall Tongues,</hi> as now they have done, which yet I dare not be ſo bold to doe.</p>
                  <p>The ſuiting of theſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> and <hi>Goſpels,</hi> as now the Church hath ordered them, was the work of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> commanded ſo to doe by Saint <hi>Damaſus</hi> Pope, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour, <hi>Anno. Dom.</hi> 367. and this may ſuffice for a ſufficient gloſſe upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective parts of this Book, and why it is framed in this Methode.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon, why I intitle it the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sodality,</hi> is, becauſe I would by that Name invite every Chriſtian to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it, and to make profeſſion of this Practiſe of Piety, which is grounded on
<pb facs="tcp:204830:29"/> 
                     <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and on the <hi>publick Prayers</hi> of Holy Church, which certainly were not made without a deep deſign, if yet that were any other than what I have gueſſed at, who ſhall be glad to hear of a better, for I am nothing wedded to my own conceit herein: I ſhall not preſume to give any Rules at all to our <hi>Sodality,</hi> though I doe humbly ſuggeſt the ſaying, Thrice a day the <hi>Trinity of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> in the end of every Part of this firſt Tome, for the Reaſons above, and for this one more which I ſhall add, becauſe by a reverent rehearſall thereof, they ſhall even kiſs, as it were in little, the <hi>Picture</hi> of our Bleſſed Lord, drawn out of the full Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it hath in the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> and <hi>Goſpels</hi> of the Day; as alſo by their weekly reading each reſpective <hi>Sundayes</hi> work belonging to the week, they ſhall make themſelves, in a ſhort ſpace, perfect maſters of ſo much Scripture, and be able, not onely to ſum it up in their daily <hi>Prayers,</hi> but to ſeaſon their diſcourſe with it throughout the week, throughout the year, from year to year, indeed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their lives.</p>
                  <p>Now that they may more zealouſly doe this, I ſhall deſire them to beleive, the firſt <hi>Founder</hi> of this <hi>Sodality</hi> was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Confirmer</hi> of it the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the firſt

<pb facs="tcp:204830:30"/> and the ſtating them into the <hi>order</hi> we now have them in, throughout the year, unto <hi>Saint Gregory the firſt,</hi> moſt worthy called the <hi>Great</hi> for his remarkable Saintity, in the year 590. who, in his <hi>Vol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Authorities</hi> I cite not ſo much to vaunt my own <hi>deſign,</hi> as to avouch I am not worthy to be Father of it, otherwiſe then by <hi>Obſervation,</hi> as above I ſaid; but thence I am bold indeed to commend the Devotion unto our <hi>Sodality</hi> as a practiſe of the moſt ſolid Piety imaginable.</p>
                  <p>And here I muſt crave leave to mind the Reader that it will very little availe a man to be of this <hi>Chriſtian Sodality,</hi> unleſs he make himſelf worthy of it by his <hi>ſaintitie,</hi> which he ſhall ſooneſt arive unto, by making the Scripture his ſtudie (as was before deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) and by taking it often in the Cordiall of Holy Churches <hi>prayers,</hi> when he doth not ſwallow the greater parts of it all at once, by reading much thereof, expounded as hee hath it here; for this will alwaies be to feed on heavenly food, ſuch as can never breed <hi>hereticall diſeaſes</hi> in the <hi>body</hi> of our <hi>Sodality,</hi> but muſt needs give ſaving nouriſhment to all our ſoules, and make us, feeding here a while on theſe ſweet <hi>honey Combs of Grace</hi>

                           <p>SHould a Turk or Heathen ask me what report this Prayer hath to the Epiſtle and Goſpel of the day, (there being ſcarce one word of either in it) I ſhould not wonder at him; but did a Chriſtian ask me ſuch a queſtion, I ſhould pitty him, as either not well Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or at leaſt as not reflecting on what he hath been taught: for example, that paſt Myſteries are by Holy Church preſentiated unto us, as now actually flowing: namely, that Advent repreſents the time when the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin Mary</hi> was near to her delivery of her Sacred Son, the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> (our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>) into this world; and for reſpect unto this time, the <hi>Antiphon</hi> of this day is taken out of the 1. of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> not out of the 21. as the Goſpel is, becauſe that 1. Chapter puts us in minde of the time which this Prayer reports unto: ſo doth the <hi>Verſicle</hi> and <hi>Reſponſory;</hi> and ſo doth the laſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphon</hi> of Advent, being one of the great Os, as we call them, importing the exclamations uſed by the holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs in their Prayers, calling upon our Saviours Birth as near at hand; and conſequently the Prayers of Advent muſt be adapted to the times paſt, to the voices of the Ancient Patriarchs and Prophets, looking up to Heaven, with their Predeceſſours, and their own wearied eyes, for four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years together; all crying out, as if they durſt not believe their own eyes, but would awake, as it were the ſleeping God, that had ſo long left the world under the laſh of a Triple Tyranny, which they did groan beneath, of Death, Sin, and Damnation; and ſpeaking (by the dictate of the holy Ghoſt) like men to God, as if there were more or leſſe of power in his Omnipotency; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him to <hi>haſten away</hi> with all his <hi>Rowſed power;</hi> and by his <hi>protecting</hi> grace, to <hi>free them from the eminent dangers</hi> they were in, that had ſlept ſo many years in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204830:37"/> night and trance of ſin, (that is to ſay, in the guilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:) and next, to <hi>deliver</hi> them from all future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due unto them for that guilt, by a <hi>ſaving ſentence</hi> in the latter day of Doom: and ſo (briefly) praying to be ſecured from all <hi>dangers</hi> they were liable unto, either of Guilt, or pain of Sin: He, I ſay, that looks upon the preſent <hi>Prayer</hi> with this reflection (which is but due unto it) will ſoon perceive the connexion it hath (by beſeeching God to <hi>Rowſe up his power, and come away</hi>) to the Epiſtle ſpecifying the greateſt roots of Sin, from the guilt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we deſire <hi>protection</hi> and <hi>freedom,</hi> by the coming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the ſource and fountain of all Grace: and to the Goſpel, telling us we are then before all the world final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, truly, and moſt abſolutely <hi>delivered</hi> from the due pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of Sin, (which is eternall damnation) when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and all his accurſed crew ſhall ſee us called at the latter day of Doom unto an everlaſting Bliſs, and Glory, by the happy ſentence of Salvation paſſed upon us: For though we are <hi>protected</hi> here, and (by the Grace of God) <hi>ſet free</hi> from the guilt of Sin, yet we are then moſt properly <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> from all <hi>danger</hi> of puniſhment for the ſame, when we are declared (which God grant) at the latter day (maugre the Devils malice) to be <hi>ſaved Souls.</hi> But that all this may more clearly appear, ſee both the letters of the Texts, in Epiſtle and Goſpel, with the Expoſitours ſenſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſuitable to this Illuſtration of the Prayer as above; and then confeſs there is more depth of ſenſe and ſpirit in the Churches Prayers, (being all dictates of the holy Ghoſt) than at firſt ſight men will imagine, or (without deep meditation) ever find out, and believe.</p>

THe <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in the immediate Verſe before had told them, That <hi>the fulneſs of the Law was Love;</hi> and ſuppoſing them thereby prepared to fulfill the ſame, by loving one another, he now adds the convenience of <hi>the ſeaſon,</hi> and happineſs of the preſent hour to encourage them to perfection: But we muſt note he applies his ſpeech both to the Jewes and Gentiles in this place; to the former, alluding unto the time when they did onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to come, whom now they can ſee with their own corporall eyes; to the latter, that their time is now come alſo, of awaking <hi>from the ſleep</hi> of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and of their other enormious ſins, being the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of all mankinde was actually come; though even the Jewes alſo, after Chriſts Birth, were faſt enough <hi>aſleep</hi> in their infidelity, (moſt of them) and ſo were capable of this ſpeech to them, even in that ſenſe too.</p>

By <hi>the night,</hi> is here meant the time before Chriſts comming, made <hi>dark</hi> as night with infidelity: By <hi>the day,</hi> the time after our Saviours Birth, rendered bright as day with the light of the Goſpel: the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>darkneſs</hi> are Sin, becauſe they ſhut out the light of grace from our Souls: the <hi>Armour of Light</hi> are acts of Vertue, works of Grace; and in theſe words Saint <hi>Paul</hi> minds us, that our life is here a ſpiritual warfare, ſince we know <hi>Armour</hi> is neceſſary for Warriours; though the Greek Text imports by <hi>Armour of Light,</hi> a kind of habit proper to the day; and this is not inconſiſtent with the other ſenſe above, for <hi>Armour</hi> is a kind of habit too.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THe two firſt Verſes of this Epiſtle are wholly and clearly deſcribing the effects of the Incarnation, and do exhort to a due Chriſtian comportment at ſuch a ſeaſon: That is, now to prepare our ſelves for our Deifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: ſince therefore God became man, that man might become God: <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods, and all ſons of the Higheſt,</hi> Pſal. 82. v. 6.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The third Verſe tells us how unſuitable all Sin muſt needs be at this ſeaſon, (though indeed it cannot be allowable at any time) but eſpecially how unſeaſonable theſe three deadly Sins now are, which here the Apoſtle ſpecifies (and under them forbids us all the reſt) <hi>Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Lechery, Envy.</hi> For nothing ſooner ſtarves a Soul to death, than a gluttonous pampering of the Body: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more odious to our God incarnate, than to pollute that humane nature which Jeſus could not endure to take upon him, but in the ſacred womb of his unpolluted Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mother. Nothing ſo unſeaſonable at this ſeaſon of love, as for a Chriſtian to <hi>envy</hi> Chriſt in his neighbour, juſt now when he coming to ſave us, commands us to love each other, as he loves us all.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <pb n="7" facs="tcp:204830:39"/>3. The laſt Verſe gives us an armour of Proof againſt all <hi>danger</hi> of ſin whatſoever: for as Jeſus, by taking our ſins upon himſelf, did redeem us; ſo we, by putting on his Vertues, may <hi>deſerve</hi> to be ſaved; that is to ſay, we may be capable of Salvation, for other <hi>deſert</hi> we have not of our ſelves, than a meer capacity of Heaven, through the merits of our Saviours death and paſſion applyed to us, cooperating towards that which we cannot operate, our own Salvations: ſince it is the onely participation of his merits, that makes us fit to receive his rewards, for thoſe we call our meritorious actions; ſuch as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> required, ſaying, <hi>He that made thee without thee, will not ſave thee without thee.</hi> Yet the ſame Doctor, leſt we ſhould preſume too much upon our ſelves, ſays alſo, <hi>When God rewards mans works, he crowns his own Gifts;</hi> for even our cooperation (whereby we merit) is the ſpeciall Gift of God.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204830:42"/> thoſe that had four thouſand years expected him; now to day we beſeech his Divine Majeſty to <hi>raiſe up our hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> him, left our but lately opened eyes from the ſleep of ſin do cloſe again, if our <hi>raiſed hearts</hi> affections do not keep them open; for lumpiſh <hi>hearts</hi> are many times the cauſe of ſleeping eyes: and indeed what <hi>hearts</hi> ſo lumpiſh as thoſe that are addicted unto lumps of fleſh, to carnall, and terrene deſires, which, as they ever draw us down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſo muſt they of neceſſity make us droniſh, and drowſie, in the ſervice of Almighty God: this day there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding the danger of a ſinfull effect, we deprecate the cauſe thereof, we pray to be rid of the lumpiſhneſs of <hi>our hearts,</hi> and that we may have them vigilant, active, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, raiſed, and rowſed up by Almighty God, to high, and Heavenly thoughts: Such as may <hi>prepare the way for Jeſus Chriſt to come amongſt us, that by his coming we may deſerve to ſerve Almighty God with purified Souls.</hi> How pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified? By loving him, and ſo deſerving to be his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Servants in a high degree indeed, as fore-runners to his Sacred Son, as Baptiſts, as Angels ſent before his face to <hi>prepare his wayes,</hi> and conſequently as men; than whom greater did never ariſe amongſt the ſons of women. Bleſſed God! to what a height of perfection doth holy Church invite her Children to day? being but on Sunday laſt raiſed from their dead ſleep, their trance of Sin? and yet no marvell; for Chriſtianity is in truth, the ſummity or top of all perfection; and of all Chriſtians we know the Catholike to be Top, and Top-gallant; that is to ſay, the higheſt of men; which conſequently ſo <hi>purifies their Souls,</hi> as they become at leaſt, the loweſt of Angels; ſince in true morality, the higheſt of the inferiour, arrives to the perfection of the loweſt of his Superiours: whence we read of Saint <hi>John Baptiſt, That he was an Angel ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of Jeſus Chriſt to prepare his wayes,</hi> Luke 7. ver. 27.</p>
                           <p>Now leſt this diſcourſe ſeeme but gratuite, and to have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:204830:43"/> little, or no connexion to the whole ſervice of the day, however we finde it genuine enough, perhaps, unto the Prayer: ſee what Leſſons of <hi>Purity</hi> and ſanctity of <hi>Soules</hi> the Epiſtle gives us, inſiſting altogether upon the higheſt of Sanctity, mutuall <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> ſuch as made the two moſt diſcordant people in the world, united perfectly in one, the Jew and Gentile, who, before they were in Chriſt united, and had <hi>their hearts raiſed</hi> up to heavenly affections, deteſted one another; but once meeting both in the love of one God, they became in Chriſt one Thing, one Body, of that undivided Church, which hath the onely Son of God to be the head thereof, our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Nay, ſee further, how this dayes Goſpel makes of humane Soules, (thus <hi>raiſed</hi> up by mutuall love, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all one God, and beleeving equally in the doctrine of his ſacred Son) Baptiſtick Saints, and conſequently ſpirits Angelicall, whilſt what is read to day of Saint <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> is ſpoken to us, as either being (or invited to be) like him, fore-runners to our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, voices crying out in the deſart</hi> of this world, <hi>prepare the wayes of our Lord.</hi> O Chriſtians! O Catholicks at leaſt! remember we are now in holy <hi>Advent,</hi> a time ſet out apart to prepare us for a worthy receiving of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour at his Nativity into this world; be it therefore ſpent, as Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did imploy his dayes, in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, faſting, praying, in purifying of our Souls, in raiſing mortall man up to the purity, immortality, and ſanctity of Angels; ſo ſhall we pray, as all our Paſtours preach to day, which is, I hope, a ſufficient adjuſting of this dayes Prayer unto the following Epiſtle and Goſpel of the day, bidding us <hi>with one mind, and one mouth glorifie God;</hi> which then we doe, when our practice and our Prayer is anſwerable to what our Paſtors teach, and preach unto us.</p>

IF <hi>what is</hi> here <hi>written</hi> be to our <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> 'tis to make us be the Saints we are not yet; 'tis to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the way, by ſhewing us how the Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile were both Saincted by Chriſtianity. The Roots whereof are the three Theologicall Vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, which indeed doe briefly ſumme up this whole Epiſtle in the laſt Verſe thereof, and are given us as the beſt preparatives to make way for Jeſus into our Hearts. Faith we ſee made Jew and Gentile both one Church. O may it grow to ſuch an excellence in us, to aboliſh Hereſie from Chriſtianity; and becauſe it is a ſpeciall gift of God, let it be our daily Prayer that he will give it unto all the World, Turk, Heathen, Pagan, Jew.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Hope keeps together thoſe that Faith uniteth, and, like an Ancre in a ſtorme, ſecures the Ship of Chriſt in higheſt ſeas of Perſecution. May then the Hope of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mercy inable us to undergo our preſent Miſery; may the example of the Saints before us encourage us to be like patterns unto our Poſterity, as they have been to us, that were our Predeceſſours.</p>
                           <p n="3">3.

                           <p n="2">2. IT was from his own Diſciples he <hi>heard</hi> the Stories of <hi>Chriſts</hi> admirable <hi>works,</hi> whileſt he was in <hi>priſon,</hi> for reprehending <hi>Herod</hi> about his unlawfull marriage with <hi>Herodias</hi> his Brothers wife: and ſo he <hi>ſends two of the ſame Diſciples</hi> to Chriſt, that they might ſee with their own eyes the wonders of his Works, and thereby leave the fond opinion they had of <hi>Iohn,</hi> his being a greater man than <hi>Ieſus.</hi> This was done in the two and thirtieth year of our Saviour, which was the ſecond of his Preaching; and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did this purpoſely to confirm his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the belief of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> being indeed the great <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was expected: leſt when <hi>Iohn</hi> was dead, (as ſoon after it happened) they might remain in doubt of that truth, which was no leſs importing, than their Soules ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; namely, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> but his fore-runner.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <pb n="23" facs="tcp:204830:47"/>3. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did not bid them ask this queſtion as a thing he doubted of, for he had, before this Baptized <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and often given many great teſtimonies of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> but onely finding he could not perſwade his Diſciples to that truth, he now ſends them to have it made undoubted unto them; not ſo much by the words, as by the prodigious works of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Though Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> askes the queſtion in his own, not in his diſciples names, to ſhew his greater skill in curing his Diſciples diſeaſe, by ſeeming himſelf to be ſick of the ſame, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Who is weak, and I am not weak?</hi> 2 Cor. 11. ver. 29. Again, the Diſciples durſt not perhaps have been ſo bold with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> had not their Maſter given them leave to ask this queſtion in his Name.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Loe, the anſwer, anſwerable unto expectation, not in words, but works: Chriſt tells them not, that he is the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but bids them <hi>goe back, and tell</hi> John <hi>what they had heard and ſeen,</hi> knowing full well, that <hi>Iohn</hi> from thence would prove unto them, he was the man they asked after, the <hi>God-man,</hi> the <hi>great Meſſias:</hi> beſides, Chriſt, by this way of anſwering, took off from himſelf all note of vanity, and gave a high example of humble modeſty, by declining to ſpeak his own praiſes, though not to doe the works whereby God was praiſed, by the affirmation of the truth without a word; and therefore Chriſt before them did actually doe many Miracles, which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> (c. 7. ver. 21.) recounts even ſuch as <hi>Eſaias,</hi> c. 35. v, 5. and c. 61 v. 1. had foretold were to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ſignes of the true <hi>Meſſias;</hi> which done, he bids <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples <hi>Goe back, and tell him what they had heard and ſeen;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, what they did ſee, was done purpoſely to give them ſatisfaction to their queſtion, which yet they did not receive as ſatisfactory, till <hi>Iohn</hi> made it ſo unto them, the more to teſtifie the truth.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Theſe were the very ſignes which <hi>Iſaias</hi> (in the places above cited) gave of the true <hi>Meſſias.</hi> By <hi>the poor</hi>
                              <pb n="24" facs="tcp:204830:48"/> are here underſtood, chiefly thoſe who are poor in Spirit, that is, voluntarily ſuch, eſteeming all worldly wealth as traſh, and coveting no riches but thoſe of grace and glory: I ſay, chiefly ſuch, becauſe among the poor whom Chriſt preached unto, his Apoſtles were the chief, who were truly poor in ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="6">6. It is hugely remarkable, that our Saviour after ſuch prodigious miracles, cloſeth with ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed is hee that is not ſcandalized in me,</hi> rather he might have ſaid, Happy are they who ſtand in Admiration, (indeed in Adoration) of me: but it wants not depth of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, that he ſayes the contrary, becauſe his poor and abject manner of life was nothing ſuitable to his ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did works; and for this reaſon he ſayes, Happy are they who are not taken off from the beliefe of my Deity, by the beholding the vility of my humanity. But his meaning was deeper yet, namely, to anſwer thereby even unto the thoughts of <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples, which hee knew, though they durſt not ſpeak them; for they were ſtaggered to behold ſo mean a man, (as his apparrel, and outward perſon ſpake him) working ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </p>
                           <p n="7">7. Not till <hi>they went away,</hi> becauſe he knew <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples had too good an opinion of their Maſter, as thinking him to be the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> ſo to have praiſed him before their faces, had been both to flatter the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:204830:48"/> Maſter, and pervert the Diſciples into a belief, their Errour was a Truth: On the other ſide ſince the people had their eyes wholly upon Chriſt, (to exerciſe his own humility, and to render them better informed of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt than it ſeems they were) he falls into <hi>Iohns</hi> praiſes to the <hi>multitude,</hi> by asking t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="8">8. Our Saviour proſecutes his deſign in the former verſe of rectifying the people in their judgements about S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> by asking them whether they thought <hi>Iohn</hi> a man flexible in his minde, as thoſe are who daily varie their apparrel, and pamper up themſelves in the moſt changeable of vices, a Mollities or ſoftneſſe of nature, yeelding and altering it ſelf at every leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion made upon it?

And leaſt they ſhould thinke they ſtood ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> his merits by believing him <hi>a Prophet,</hi> our Saviour asks even that queſtion, as if it were below St. <hi>Iohns</hi> titles to be a <hi>Prophet,</hi>
                              <pb n="26" facs="tcp:204830:49"/> and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, he is <hi>more than a Prophet.</hi> Why? be cauſe <hi>Prophets</hi> onely foretell future things, but <hi>John</hi> both told the people the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was ſuddenly to come, and had beſides the honour to ſhew him to them, as well as to tell them of him: So he was truly a <hi>Prophet, and more than a Prophet.</hi>

WHat our Saviour in the Baptiſt did commend, holy Church to us now recommends, His Fortitude, his Auſterity, and his Angelicall Purity: We ſhall profeſſe the firſt by not onely ſtanding the ſhock of open perſecution, but that alſo of the inward warre our ſenſes make perpetually againſt our Reaſon: if we ſhall rather chooſe to die, than to commit the leaſt ſinne againſt Almighty God; for thus we ſhew the fortitude of Grace, while we repell the aſſaults of Nature.</p>

And firſt, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the time of <hi>Advent,</hi> alluding to that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the reall Birth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wherein the holy Patriarchs and Prophets prayed, as we have heard in the two foregoing Sundayes; but with this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſtill the nearer we come to the Feaſt of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> the nearer the Prayers repreſent <hi>Chriſt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and now indeed ſo near, as if upon the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of two Prayers onely gone before, <hi>Chriſt</hi> were come already ſo farre on his way from Heaven to Earth, that we may now even whiſper in his ear, (as this Prayer ſeemes to doe) begging the <hi>Loan of his Eares</hi> unto us in his tranſient carreer, as if each of us were forced to ſtop him on his way for ſome Emolumentall occaſion particular to our ſelves, while we ſay, <hi>Lend, we beſeech thee, O Lord, thine ear to our Prayers;</hi> or as if our guilty Conſciences perſwaded us he might be ſtill as deaf to us (though at hand, according to the Epiſtle) as he had been to all the world beſide for four thouſand years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and therefore we are now taught humbly to round him in the <hi>Ear;</hi> and, as it were, with a fervorous zeal, to run like Lacquies after him, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the favour of a private whiſper as he goes, and that meerly to tell him our caſe is worſe than others, that his generall <hi>Grace of Viſitation</hi> to the whole world, will hardly be enough for us, unleſs he pleaſe particularly <hi>to enlighten the darkneſſe of our minde with the</hi> (particular) <hi>grace of his</hi> ſpeciall <hi>Viſitation</hi> to us, though it be by an application onely of his <hi>Ear</hi> to our particular ſuite, as he runs poſting through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart of common ſinne, where we (more ſadly each than other) may piouſly believe we lie inſnared, and want
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:204830:51"/> a little glimmering <hi>of Grace</hi> (more than ordinary) to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten</hi> us, that we may firſt ſeeing, lament, and then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, expiate our ſelves of all our ſinnes whatſoever againſt the bleſſed time of his Nativity: and indeed the beſt way to avail our ſelves of the annuall Feaſts (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe which are myſteries of our redemption) is to preſentiate the ſame as now actually flowing, and firſt being arrived to our knowledges: for ſo ſhall our ſouls be raiſed unto a piety ſuitable to the thing, as well as to the time that puts it into our minds: And what Chriſtian is there ſo obdurate, ſo ſtony-hearted, as if he could every year perſwade himſelf (which holy Church exhorts us to, both by our Paſtours and our Prayers) that things were then in doing, which he knowes are done, and that himſelf were an actor in each Scean, in each Feaſt or Myſtery repreſented, would not relent and ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten towards his God, who like a melted Goodneſſe came to pour out himſelf amongſt us.</p>
                           <p>This, this beloved, were the part of good Chriſtians, to pray now in this ſenſe, to run like Lacquies (nay like ſhadowes) near up to the new Incarnate God, who being in himſelf an Inacceſſable light, was fain to ecclipſe his Glory in the cloud of humane Nature; that ſo within the ſhadow of his ſhade-yeilding body, we might approach unto him, and whiſper our neceſſities in his ſacred <hi>Ears,</hi> who now as man, will hear us, however as God, the whole world ſeemed to cry out in vain to him for 4000. years together.</p>
                           <p>Say then, Beloved, this Prayer to day, with this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Duty, this All-ghoſtly ſenſe dictated unto us by the holy Ghoſt, and we ſoon ſhall ſee the effect it worketh in us, towards rendring us the perfect Chriſtians, that this dayes Epiſtle exhorts us to be, <hi>Joyfull, modeſt, reſigned, thankfull, and peacefull,</hi> even to the <hi>ſurpaſſing</hi> the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;</hi> nay more, <hi>inlightned</hi> Angels running before the face of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to his Crib, where born, he will
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:204830:51"/> immediately diſpence in ample manner the ſpeciall <hi>Grace of his viſitation to us all,</hi> that thus (like Baptiſts as the Goſpell to day exhorts) ſhall now <hi>prepare his wayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him</hi> to the future Feaſt of his Nativity. And thus we ſee both Epiſtle and Goſpell of this day, though not litterally, yet Myſtically (if not as it were eminentially too) included in this Prayer above.</p>

                           <p n="4">4. TO <hi>Rejoice,</hi> that they were Chriſtians, and had the happineſs of true Faith, true Hope, true Charity: This the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> meant by <hi>rejoycing in our Lord,</hi> in his holy gifts of Spirit beſtowed upon them, not that he had made them noble, rich, or great Perſons, but religious Chriſtians: for this he bids them <hi>alwayes rejoyce in our Lord; again, and again rejoyce:</hi> And when he ſaid <hi>always,</hi> he meant as well in affliction, as in proſperity, becauſe to zealous Souls no humane trouble ought to be diſturbing, ſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:204830:52"/> long as they have the comfort of a good Cauſe, and a good Conſcience too.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>Modeſty</hi> is a vertue giving a mean to all the actions of a man, and therefore that we might ſee Chriſtianity ſets all things in order both with the inward, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts the <hi>Philippians</hi> to give a proof of their perfection in Chriſtianity by their <hi>Modeſty;</hi> and by ſuch a <hi>modeſty,</hi> as might <hi>be known to all men;</hi> ſuch a <hi>modeſty,</hi> as puts a gracefull bluſh upon all their actions, leſt any one might ſee the infirmity of man in him, who was become more than man, by beeing a true and perfect Chriſtian; and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us here, we ſhould ſtand upon a <hi>modeſt</hi> guard, becauſe <hi>our Lord,</hi> who is to be our Judge, <hi>is nigh,</hi> and hath his eyes upon us, as needs he muſt, when he gives us the concourſe of his Divine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance towards our each thought and deed: but <hi>our Lords</hi> being <hi>nigh,</hi> may now in <hi>Advent,</hi> be applyed to the Nativity of our Saviour; and for this purpoſe holy Church appoints that place of Scripture to be read to day, though litterally the Text alludes to the latter day of Doom.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. By <hi>Care</hi> is here meant Anxiety or trouble of minde, not that he prohibits a diligence, a due regard to doe what is on our parts to be done, but beyond that he will not have us goe; he forbids us all anxious ſollicitude, and recommends a perfect reſignation of our ſelves, to the will and pleaſure of Almighty God. And though he bids us have <hi>a care</hi> to pray upon all occaſions, as well of Proſperity, as of Adverſity: yet he allowes not any ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous <hi>care</hi> in us about the effect of our Prayer, whether we obtain our requeſts, or not, made unto God by Prayer, but will have us leave that freely to his Divine Majeſty; for indeed Beggars (who want all things) muſt not chooſe what ſupply they will firſt receive, but humbly accept of whatſoever is given; and if denyed, they may ask again, but never muſt be troubled when they are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:204830:52"/> refuſed: nor is <hi>our Prayer</hi> to God, other than an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our deſpicable beggery, and exigence of all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, both for Body and Soul, and ſince from him we receive all our ſupplyes (what hand ſoever it be that gives relief) to him muſt our <hi>Prayer,</hi> to him our <hi>Supplication,</hi> to him <hi>our thanks;</hi> and (for his ſake) to thoſe that are his Meſſengers, his Miniſters of help unto us, and then we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him, when we thank them, by whom he hands his Bleſſings to us.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. <hi>By the peace of God</hi> we may here underſtand, either that <hi>increated peace,</hi> which is God himſelf, whereof peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures participate, or <hi>the peace</hi> which Chriſt made between God and Man, by his paſſion appeaſing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wrath, or <hi>the peace</hi> which we make among our ſelves, when we forgive each other our Offences; or <hi>the peace</hi> we have within our ſelves of a quiet Conſcience; for all, and every one of theſe, are truly called <hi>the Peace of God:</hi> And yet when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes, That <hi>peace which paſſeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</hi> he ſeemes to incline to the firſt and laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>Peace;</hi> for as that ſurpaſſeth the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of Angels; ſo this is indeed paſt all <hi>humane underſtanding</hi> to know, how unquiet man can attain the happineſs of that <hi>peace,</hi> which a quiet conſcience affords him, ſince it calmes all the tempeſts of outward perſecution and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and makes a man by the equality of his mind, equally to bear all unequalls whatſoever can befall him, <hi>keeping our hearts</hi> (our wills) and our <hi>Intelligences</hi> (our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings) ſtill ſixt upon Almighty God, ſtill adhering unto him, and united to his ſacred Son, our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. IN the firſt Verſe of this Epiſtle we are taught how to comport our ſelves towards God, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes rejoicing in him,</hi> to bear even the afflictions of this world with a contented mind. So Saint <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>We glory even in our tribulations,</hi> and glory we cannot in any thing that gives us not content, that doth not joy our hearts; for the momentary tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of this world (born with patience) ſecure us of eternall conſolations in the next. Whence the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. ſayes, <hi>As it were ſad, yet alwayes rejoicing,</hi> becauſe in our patient ſuffering we ſerve and glorifie <hi>The God of all conſolation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. In the ſecond Verſe ſee how we are to demean our ſelves towards our neighbour, <hi>Modeſtly ever, becauſe our Lord is nigh.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, we can never look upon our Neighbour, but as on our fellow ſervant holding up the hanging to let our common Maſter in to us, that followes him purpoſely to ſee how we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean our ſelves to one another; which muſt needs be <hi>Modeſtly</hi> in his preſence. And when is he abſent, who alwayes is between us? alwayes indeed within us? An excellent cloſe tie to humane <hi>modeſty;</hi> ever to behave our ſelves as in the Preſence chamber of his Heavenly Majeſty.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. What followes in this Epiſtle, is to teach us our behaviour towards our ſelves. That is to ſay, reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our own infirmity, to be ever asking health of Soul and Body, ever praying to God in all our exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, not looſing our labour to ask relief or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from one another, who are all invellopt in a maſſe of common miſery: ſo the ſureſt way to finde comfort, is to caſt our care away, and to reſigne our ſelves to God,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:204830:53"/> to beg of him alone what ere we lack. For if we have his <hi>open car,</hi> him preſent with us, all is well; all at peace with God and Man.</p>
                           <p>Whence it is we beg to day as above, that <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Prayers,</hi> he will <hi>graciouſly</hi> viſit our hearts, and by ſo doing <hi>inlighten</hi> them in theſe Triple Duties aforeſaid, as fit prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives in Advent, for the approaching Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of our Lord.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:204830:54"/> their deſire was to know, what his office was, beſides his dignity, ſeeing him teach, preach, baptize, and doe more than ever any man had done before him: and however this queſtion ſavoured of malice (in ſome) to Chriſt, and therefore they would rather have <hi>Iohn</hi> to be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> than <hi>Ieſus,</hi> yet in others it argued malice to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and theſe reſolved to blame him, if he undertook more than his Commiſſion; ſo they aske him, <hi>Who he was,</hi> but undoubtedly it was by divine Ordinance too they were moved to <hi>ask</hi> this queſtion, that thereby the veritie of Chriſts being the true <hi>Meſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> might appear, not onely, by our Saviours own works, but alſo by <hi>Iohns</hi> confeſſion.</p>

THe <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſeemes here to bid <hi>Man eſteem</hi> of him (and his Aſſociates in the Apoſtolate) as if they were not men, but <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> for as much as they did the Offices of God, by being <hi>diſpenſers of his Myſteries;</hi> and indeed that is moſt true, for though to be a Steward, or maſter of a Family under any temporall Lord, and to diſpence, and diſpoſe of his Lords Monies and Goods, be not to execute an office above man, in regard all the goods and monies in the Stewards hands are temporall things, and the properties of nothing above a humane creature; yet to be Steward of the Houſe of God, and to have the <hi>diſpenſing</hi> of ſuch goods as are Spirituall, and cannot be the properties of any temporall Lord, certainly this renders a man (though not in nature more than Man) yet by Office hugely more than an Angel: for though we read of them, that they are, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Miniſtring Spirits</hi> in the Houſe, or Church of God, both triumphant, militant, and patient; yet we never read that they were ſtiled the <hi>diſpenſing</hi> ſpirits <hi>of Gods hidden Myſteries;</hi> which yet, as the Apoſtles were, ſo muſt their ſuucceſſours, the Prieſts of holy Church be too, and conſequently are not in the execution of that Spirituall Office to be looked on, or eſteemed as men, but as <hi>Miniſters</hi> of a higher nature, as perſons indeed more than Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, ſince they have an Office and Power above An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; namely, to forgive Sins, and to <hi>diſpence,</hi> or diſpoſe of Gods ſeverall Graces, by the conduit of holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Pipes, made on purpoſe (by our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>) to convey unto our barren Souls the fertilizing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:204830:59"/> waters of heavenly grace; and theſe pipes are ſo put into the hands of Prieſts, as they can turn the cock at pleaſure, give, or retain this holy grace, as they judge fit, to <hi>adminiſter a</hi> Sacrament, or ſuſpend a Sinner from the benefit thereof. But we muſt further note the Apoſtle here, as he ſpeaks in generall to all Chriſtians, and bids them eſteem Prieſts above men by reaſon of their office, ſo he ſpeaks particularly to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in order to their main contention, which was to make a difference betwixt the <hi>Diſpenſers of theſe Myſteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> as if Baptiſm (for example) received from one, were of more value, than if they were baptized by another, or as if the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Baptiſm were the Authors of grace, and ſo they who received it at a more holy mans hands, received more, than if the conferror thereof were leſſe holy; to both theſe effects the Apoſtle ſpeaks, correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Corinthians</hi> errour in them both, that is, for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Adminiſtrator of a Sacrament to be the Author of grace therein conferred, or that grace was more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly conferred, according as the Adminiſtrators there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were more or leſſe holy.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 This alludes to the vanity of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who were men ſo curious, that they judged of their Preachers as they found them, more wiſe, more grave, more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in their Sermons or Catechiſms than others, and particularly they adhered much to <hi>Apollo,</hi> becauſe they held him more eloquent than S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whereas the ſame Apoſtle here tells them, they muſt not regard in the <hi>Diſpenſers</hi> of Gods word, the Rhetorick, language, or eloquence of the preachers, but above all their <hi>fidelity,</hi> or being <hi>faithfull,</hi> that is, to have them tell the true ſence and meaning of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to have them give rather ſound, than flouriſhing doctrine, leaſt while they put too much force in words, they loſe the vigour of the Spirit, which is, and ought to be the life of a Sermon, and leaſt they ſeek by the Oſtentation of their langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:204830:59"/> rather their own, than the glory of God, or preach themſelves, not <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them here, <hi>fidelity</hi> is the principall part of a preacher, that is, to preach the Word of God, and not the word of man, to preach ſpirit rather than language, to move the ſoul to Acts of love, rather than the ear to delight of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. This Verſe proſecutes the ſenſe of the former, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them plainly he did not regard their fond <hi>judgements,</hi> that eſteemed men by their glib tongues, rather than by their vertuous ſpirits; for it is indeed <hi>Unction,</hi> (a ſpeciall gift of the Holy Ghoſt) that renders a Preacher moſt profitable to ſouls, and ſo moſt accompliſht in his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whence the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> knowing what he ſaid was pure ſpirit, told them he did not regard their cenſures of him, as if he were defective in his duty of preaching, and what he ſayes to them in this kinde, he affirmes the like in reſpe &amp; of all men by his following words, wherein he makes no account of <hi>mans day,</hi> that is, of humane judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a point of Spirit; for thus <hi>the day of man</hi> is often taken, as by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> it was, Chap. 17. v. 16. when being derided by the people, who contemned his Prophecies, he cryed out, <hi>Thou knoweſt O Lord, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not the dayes</hi> (the applauſe) <hi>of men, nor regard their judgements of me;</hi> Suffice it, I have delivered unto them what thou haſt to me revealed: So in this ſenſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> here cares not for the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> whether they like his preaching or not, but is content that he tells them the genuine ſenſe of his Lord and Maſter, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and yet leaſt he may by this ſpeech ſeem arrogant, See how hee takes off all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vanity in himſelf by what follows, ſaying, Though I am not troubled, O <hi>Corinthians,</hi> at what you thinke or judge of me, yet neither am I ſo vain as to preſume I am without fault, and ſo I neither will nor dare to <hi>judge my ſelf,</hi> this place might diſſwade Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204830:60"/> from preſuming they are certain of their future ſalvation, and of their being here in the ſtate of grace, if themſelves thinke ſo, aſſuredly S. <hi>Paul</hi> might better juſtifie himſelf, and yet we ſee he does not, indeed he dares not doe it.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. While in this next verſe he ſaith, <hi>though I am not guilty</hi> particularly of any <hi>infidelity,</hi> vanity, or oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in preaching, (for ſtill he proſecutes that ſenſe, which yet generally may be underſtood of any ſin,) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe <hi>I am not juſtified therein</hi> he will not juſtifie himſelf,) <hi>but he that judgeth me is our Lord,</hi> and to him I muſt leave it to judge, who not onely ſees and knows all hearts, but perfectly knows them too, that is, ſees further and clearer into all mens hearts, than any one man can ſee into his own.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Here the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> referrs not onely his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf, and of his Miniſtery, but even the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all men whatſoever to the latter day of Doom; for then (and not till then) <hi>Our Lord ſhall come, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the hidden things of darkneſs,</hi> by laying all things open, and this not onely (as ſome Hereticks will have it) whether we believe right or wrong, but alſo whether we doe good or bad deeds according to our Faith: For ſo by the plurality of <hi>hidden things</hi> here mentioned to be revealed then, is clearly meant in thoſe words of the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> inſomuch that Hereticks fondly pretend unto a certainty of their rectitude in Faith, more than they can doe unto a rectitude in their works, and therefore flatter themſelves, that be their works <hi>(the counſels of their hearts)</hi> what they will, yet ſince it is by Faith men are juſtified, and ſince they pretend to know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that they doe rightly beleeve, they therefore ſcruple not to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              <pb n="49" facs="tcp:204830:60"/> Chap. 9. v. 1. <hi>A man knoweth not whether he be worthy of love or hatred.</hi> So Prov. 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay, my heart is clean?</hi> So Job 9 21. <hi>If I bee ſimple or Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, yet my ſoul knoweth it not.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. v. 9. <hi>Wicked is the heart of man, and inſcrutable,</hi> unleſſe to God alone: To conclude, the ſentence of Judgement ſhall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſe upon our Faith, whether that be right or wrong, but upon our works, <hi>the Counſels of our hearts,</hi> for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhall in that day receive according to his works: and <hi>Luke</hi> 20. we receive <hi>what our works deſerve;</hi> and in the mean time till the day of generall judgement come, the Apoſtle forbids to judge each other, ſince neither he, nor any man can ſecurely and rightly judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but then look who hath done and deſerved well, <hi>the praiſe ſhall be to every one of God,</hi> though miſtaking men have judged thoſe perhaps worthy of blame, whom God ſhall declare to be praiſe-worthy, becauſe he finds them to have been faithfull to the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> or truſt which he repoſed in them: So here we ſee from firſt to laſt, St <hi>Paul</hi> his true ſenſe in this place is upon <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in the <hi>diſpenſers of the Myſteries of God,</hi> and declares, that no man but God can judge in that particular, as being an office not appertaining to men, but to God himſelf, and unto him alone: I muſt here advertiſe you, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the next Verſe declares that he uſeth his own, and <hi>Apollo</hi>'s name but figuratively, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to repreſent to the Chriſtians their faults, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to have one more light of grace than another, or to be one better able than another to underſtand the Scriptures, ſhewing it is a thing they ought as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to preſume of in themſelves, as to cenſure whether he or <hi>Apollo</hi> did more <hi>faithfully</hi> perform the truſt of God repoſed in them, by their <hi>miniſtery of diſpenſators of his Myſteries.</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. THe cloſing Advent ſeaſon claimes a due regard in this dayes ſervice, ſo the prayer begins, alluding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, and ends beſides with the accuſtomary reference to the Epiſtle of the day. How like the out-cryes of the ancient Prophets is the ſtile of Holy Churches prayer to day. They cryed out thus, <hi>O Wiſedome! O Adonai! O Root of Jeſſe! O Key of David! O Riſing Sun! O King of Nations! O Emmanuel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Come and ſave us, thou that art our Lord God.</hi> And we, promiſing all theſe exclamations, pray as above. <hi>O Lord we beſeech thee, raiſe up thy power, and with thy mighty vertue, come away to our ſuccour,</hi> &amp;c. meaning all the power, and all the Vertue included in thoſe Attributes of <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Adonai, King,</hi> and Saviour, which the Prophets gave him as above.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. And leaſt our ſins do chaſe away the coming Jeſus, ſee this Epiſtle points us to the Prieſts of holy Church, as <hi>to the Miniſters of Chriſt, and diſpenſers of the Myſteries of God,</hi> Meaning of the Holy Sacraments, that blot out ſin, and give us grace to bid our Saviour welcome.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Hence we conclude, the Paſtors and the People are admoniſhed to buckle to their ſeverall Devoirs to day, theſe in adminiſtring, theſe in receiving of the Holy Sacraments, and yet each having done his dutie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to preſume he hath done well enough, but both referring of themſelve to God his <hi>Judgements</hi> for the future, and expecting his mercies for the preſent, <hi>And to pray as Holy Church above appoints, That</hi> our ſinnes doe not retard the coming of his mercy towards us.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. ST. <hi>Paul</hi> had in the precedent Chapter told the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians,</hi> that the old Law of the Jews; was a <hi>Paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi> (or Uſher rather) to the new Law of Chriſt, and ſo was to ceaſe when the new Law came: This doctrine he follows now here cloſely, ſaying, The Jewes that were the choſen people of God, his firſt begotten, as it were, and ſo his <hi>heirs,</hi> were by all the help of their Lawes but as <hi>little ones</hi> in the ſight of God, that is, as children or infants wanting maturity of yeares, and ripeneſſe of judgement to govern themſelves, and thus were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different <hi>from ſervants,</hi> becauſe they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded abſolutely by the Patriarchs and Prophets (being themſelves ſervants of God, though maſters of the people) who were indeed <hi>Lords of all</hi> Gods graces and favours; ſince no nation ſhared thereof beſide the Jews.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> follows his example, and proves there is no difference between a <hi>Lord</hi> under the command of <hi>Tutors</hi> and <hi>Governours,</hi> and a meer ſervant, ſince this <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>heir</hi> is not (all the while of his Minority) to rule and command, but to obey his ſtewards and governours, who are then the Fathers, and ſhall after be their young Pupills ſervants too, and this time in thoſe dayes of the old Law, laſted till the heir was twenty five yeers of age.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here applyes this argument to himſelf formerly of the Jewiſh Religon, and conſequently an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, or <hi>little one,</hi> in the line of thoſe that are Gods true ſervants, namely Chriſtians; ſerving God onely <hi>under</hi> the Alphabet of a religious Law, that is under the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:204830:66"/> or <hi>Elements</hi> of the world, which were the old Law, (all the rule men had to ſerve God by) and then, ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> we were like <hi>little ones,</hi> young lords and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by birth-right of our Judaiſm, yet nothing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from ſervants, ſince we had that Law, but as an Uſher to bring us up, and deliver us over to another, much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indeed, a moſt perfect Law of Grace, whereunto the old Law was a meer type or figure, a meer Element or Alphabet of a true Law. Note by <hi>the Elements of the world</hi> are here underſtood the letter of the law given to the men of the world, in thoſe at leaſt, who were the ſelect thereof, the Jewes, for if the <hi>world</hi> were here taken for other than the men thereof, the Elements of the naturall world were to bee underſtood earth, aire, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fire, but ſince by the <hi>world</hi> is meant the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof, therefore <hi>Element</hi> here, ſtands <hi>for the letter of the old</hi> (ceremoniall and ſervile) <hi>Law,</hi> whence the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> here uſeth the word of <hi>ſerving</hi> very aptly, for there are three <hi>ſervings</hi> in this word related unto: The Firſt, that of heathens ſerving their Idols as their Gods: The ſecond, that of the Jews ſerving God by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure creatures ordered unto Gods ſervice: The laſt that of Chriſtians ſerving God by pure creatures, not by Idols, nor by bloudie ſacrifices, but by ſuch as in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are ſanctifyed, and ſo are more than Jewiſh Elements of ſanctity, as the <hi>Rhemiſts Annotations</hi> have at large expreſſed, though true it is, many by the <hi>elements</hi> here underſtand, alſo the feſtivall and ſolemn dayes, moneths, and yeares, which the Jews very ſuperſtitiouſly obſerved, and made themſelves indeed, not onely ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants thereof, but even ſlaves unto them, and this, becauſe in the tenth verſe of this Chapter, S. <hi>Paul</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions their formalities upon theſe dayes, moneths, times, and yeares.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. By <hi>the fulneſſe of time</hi> is here literally underſtood, that time when Chriſt by the authority of his Father,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:204830:67"/> ſending him for that purpoſe, came to abrogate the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile law of the Jews, and to deliver us a more filiall law of love, liberty, and grace; for then was the <hi>time</hi> of the old law <hi>filled</hi> up, when it was no longer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, when we were no more to bee under the <hi>Uſhers</hi> and <hi>Tutors</hi> of Religion, but under Chriſt himſelf, the true Lord and maſter of the whole, (and ſpecially of the Chriſtian) world. That <hi>the Son of God</hi> ſent unto us, is here ſaid <hi>to be made of a woman</hi> wants not a deep ſenſe, namely to ſhew he was not begotten, nor conceived of his fathers ſeed, but was made and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wholly out of the pure ſubſtance and blood of his bleſſed mother, the <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi> where we are to note the word <hi>woman</hi> in this place doth not ſignifie any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture or corruption, which doth accompany the loſſe of virginity, when maids paſſe from their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal purity, to the impurer ſtate of corrupted woman, but <hi>woman</hi> here ſignifies directly the ſex, or female kinde of man, and ſo in that ſenſe is competent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a virgin, who is alſo of the female Sex: again he was ſaid to be <hi>made of a woman,</hi> to declare the falſity of the <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſtick</hi> hereſies, teaching Chriſt to have been made of ſome aeriall, and not of an earthly ſubſtance, as if he had brought his body (ready made in the heavens) out of ſome aeriall combinations, into the womb of the virgin, and had not received his fleſh from her; whereas the true Chriſtian doctrine teacheth; he was fleſh of her fleſh, and bone of her bones; He is further ſaid to be made <hi>under the Law,</hi> not that by right he was ſubject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto (even as man) becauſe his perſon was divine, by the union of his two natures, making but one onely ſacred and divine perſon, ſo called from his principal, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, but that indeed he was pleaſed to ſubject him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the law, though of right he were above it, and thus he vouchſafed alſo to undergo (voluntarily) the law of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:204830:67"/> rather to take it honourably away, than to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject us to ſo diſhonourable a ſlavery, as that of the Old Law was.</p>

                           <p>VVE were taught by the laſt Sundayes Prayer, to beſeech Almighty God to ſet our actions right, and by the Gnomon of his own bleſſed will to point them out their way, to direct them in their motion. Now we are further taught to beg, that even <hi>our deſires</hi> propending us to action, may not onely be begun, but <hi>proſecuted</hi> with <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly piety,</hi> leaſt good beginnings have an evill ending, if not <hi>proſecuted</hi> with the ſame holy Spirit that began them firſt; and leſt humane <hi>piety</hi> prove but a blind guide, we petition the <hi>heavenly</hi> to lead us on, that ſo we may cleerly <hi>ſee what is by us to be done,</hi> and <hi>ſeeing what it is, may be able to performe our duty</hi> both to God and man: yes, beloved, This is the clear and genuine ſenſe of the Prayer above; but how to adjuſt the preſent time to the Epiſtle and Goſpel of the day, will not perhaps eaſily appear, unleſs we doe reflect upon the Feaſt of the <hi>Epiphany</hi> at preſent, flowing in the <hi>Octaves</hi> thereof, and conſequently requiring, that whileſt in this Feaſt our Bleſſed Saviour was pleaſed to appear, as well to <hi>Gentiles</hi> as to <hi>Jews,</hi> in a word to all the world, our generall prayer ſhould be, that we may at the ſame time, appear to him ſuch ſupplyants, as he moſt delights in, namely, ſuch as beg, he will vouchſafe to ſhew us, as well his pleaſure as his perſon, by <hi>proſecuting with heavenly piety,</hi> not onely all our actions, but even our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; for then we ſhall ſee him as clearly indeed, as in the thick fog of this ſinfull world, he can be ſeen by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane eyes, when his <hi>heavenly piety</hi> begins and <hi>proſecutes</hi> all our <hi>deſires;</hi> when through the glaſs of his <hi>heavenly piety,</hi> we ſhall diſcern, what is the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> and <hi>perfect will</hi> of God, whereunto the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> this day exhorts us to conforme our ſelves both <hi>in body and mind,</hi> not onely in our own, but in our neighbours occaſions too; helping them as readily, as our own hands would help
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:204830:74"/> our hungry mouthes to meat. And if we will take the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as it muſt report to us, we ſhall ſee it ſet to the ſame tune as we pray to doe: for what is the reſult of all the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but in a word to tell us, <hi>Heavenly piety</hi> muſt be the ſquare of all our actions: Did not loſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> tell his ſorrowing Parents this in termes, when they had found him out again, and began to expoſtulate his loſſe, asking them, if <hi>they knew not he was bound to be imployed in thoſe things which were his Fathers will?</hi> his heavenly Fathers will he meant, for it was not his earthly Parents will to have him loſt.

And who can now complain, there wants connexion in this Prayer unto the other ſervice of the day? if any doe, let him ſee how (to comply with the <hi>heavenly piety</hi> of his Eternall Father.) <hi>Jeſus</hi> was Thirty years together ſubject to his Temporall Mother, and then we ſhall ſoon find out a way how to ſweeten the ſour of our humane actions, by having no <hi>deſire</hi> to any of them leſs than <hi>heavenly,</hi> nor to doe them with leſs than <hi>heavenly piety.</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had in his former Chapter told them much of the <hi>mercies of Almighty God,</hi> and ſhewed them how though the wicked were juſtly condemned, yet even the Bleſſed were moſt <hi>mercifully</hi> ſaved; hence by that <hi>mercy</hi> ſo much inculcated immediately before, he now conjures them, that as they had now received from him the <hi>rule of Faith,</hi> ſo they would frame their manners, their actions, and lives according to that <hi>rule:</hi> ſee what is ſaid of this Rule in the next Sundayes Epiſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 6. But to the preſent Text wherein the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here <hi>beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> them by the <hi>mercy</hi> ſo much above recommended, to live good lives anſwerable to their rule of Faith, and to <hi>exhibite their bodies</hi> (by action) as well as their ſouls (by Faith) <hi>a living hoſt to God.</hi> There are many who looſe the literall ſenſe of this place, by contenting themſelves with the divers (and thoſe excellent) myſticall meanings thereof: as firſt, by ſaying our bodies are living, when our lives are vertuous; Secondly, when we are charitable becauſe charity is the life of all vertues. Thirdly, when
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:204830:75"/> we have received the Sacrament of Chriſt his Body and Bloud, but in very deed the literall alluſion here is to the antient bloudy Sacrifices both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> made of beaſts dead bodies, whereunto the daily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy Sacrifice of the Evangelicall Lamb is diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite, firſt of the living Body and bloud of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> next of living, chaſtized, but not mortified bodies of Chriſtians, being, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> adviſeth, offered up to the ſervice of Almighty God, ſince ſuch chaſtizements leave the bodies living by a naturall life: again, they live by the ſpirituall life of good works, done in obedience to their ſoules command for ſo operating: beſides by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall mortification or pennance, the body is made truly a <hi>living hoſt,</hi> becauſe it is mortified alive by becoming ſubject to the command of the Spirit, for all mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a kind of living death, whileſt it makes the body dye to concupiſcence, and live to grace: but theſe our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies muſt further be <hi>holy Sacrifices,</hi> that is to ſay, imployed <hi>in holy,</hi> not prophane or impure works, not worſhipping Idols, (as the Gentiles did) but God, as befits good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, not polluting their bodies with unchaſt actions, but keeping them pure and undefiled, for this purity is by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7) called ſanctity, and is ſuch indeed. Again, this bodily <hi>hoſt</hi> muſt be <hi>pleaſing to God,</hi> for it may be <hi>living</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> in it ſelf, and yet not <hi>pleaſing</hi> to God, if the offerer be diſpleaſing, ſince many there are who faſt, goe in pilgrimage to holy places, doe other corporall pennances, and yet not rectifying together their ſouls obliquities, their paſſions of the mind are nothing <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> to God. Laſtly, he concludes, exhorting that our offerings to God be ſeaſoned with the ſalt of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that is, be alwayes <hi>a reaſonable ſervice,</hi> not fond, childiſh, curious, indiſcreet, or ſingular, but ſuch as we may ever render a <hi>reaſonable</hi> account of even to God, who will not allow of indiſcretions for reaſons; though indeed the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here alludes to the irrationall offerings
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:204830:75"/> among the Gentiles, who made their Idols their Gods, and dedicated their ſervices to Stocks and Stones; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he would have Chriſtians be more <hi>reaſonable,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of dead beaſts, to offer their <hi>living bodies</hi> joyntly with the acts of their believing, hoping, and loving ſouls, to be a perpetuall Sacrifice or ſervice to God all their life time, and thus the whole creature will become not a corporall, not an irrationall, but a ſpirituall and <hi>reaſonable</hi> Sacrifice.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath pleaſed to make a diſjunctive recommends of this entire creature in way of Sacrifice to God, while in the former verſe he inſiſted cheifly on the corporall part of the creature, which we are, and ſo adviſed how to render our <hi>bodies</hi> a living <hi>Sacrifice to God,</hi> but in this verſe he tells us how to render our better part, the ſoul of man, an acceptable oblation to the divine Majeſty, and ſince Chriſtian perfection conſiſts as well in declining evill, as in doing good, therefore this verſe begins with removing evill out of our way, that ſo we may doe good, which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> underſtands, when he bids us take heed we doe not <hi>conforme</hi> our actions to the courſe of this unconformable world; and this we ſhall performe by avoiding the evill that we ſee in men; for we ſhall then beſt ſhew, that we doe not <hi>conforme</hi> unto ſinfull men, when we fly their company, and avoid ſuch actions as renders them ſinners; and having thus followed the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative part of this counſell, we are the better prepared to put the poſitive part thereof in execution: for by not conforming to the world, we (whoſe bodies are made up of the old worldly metall) ſhall <hi>be reformed in the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our minds</hi> by ſetting them henceforward on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, which heretofore were imployed wholly upon earthly cogitations: ſo the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> by bidding us not conform to this world, did not mean to forbid us making uſe of it, but not to figure our ſelves like unto it, that is, not to become vain, proud, idle, and the like, as the world
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:204830:76"/> is, for ſo we make our ſelves figures of this world, or variable as worldlings are; whereas the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> deſires us to avoid becoming mutable or tranſitory figures, and wiſheth us to become perſiſting formes rather, which are of a permanent nature, namely, ſpirituall formes of Saints, not worldly figures of men: and here reformation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in truth Transformation, that is Tranſition, or paſſing out of the old figure of Sinners, into the new form of Saints, and beſides, St. <hi>Paul</hi> recommends the forme of <hi>newneſſe</hi> unto us, to ſhew he deſires not ſo much our innovation as our reformation, that is, not to have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new creatures in nature, but reformed ones in grace, ſuch as by <hi>newneſſe</hi> of the Spirit caſt off the Antiquity of fleſh and bloud; or ſuch as by new grace reform old na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for Antiquity in the holy Story of man reports to old <hi>Adam,</hi> to originall ſin, ſickneſſe, and death, the effects thereof, but <hi>newneſſe</hi> relates to Chriſt renewing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of old <hi>Adam</hi> in us, by the ſpritely or youthfull grace of God; and this <hi>newneſſe of mind</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> requires, as a meanes to know and <hi>prove, what the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God is;</hi> for by proof is here meant experimentall knowledge of the aforeſaid wills, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this <hi>newneſſe</hi> we can have no notion thereof; for the old man in us makes us ſenſible of nothing at all, that reports in the leaſt to God, all the means we have to come unto this knowledge of his will is, by reforming our ſelves in the <hi>newneſſe</hi> of our Spirit, that ſo we may know the will of a Spirit, and not remain in the ignorance of an unknowing body, or corporall man, who knows nothing at all of God: The beſt acception of this place is, when by <hi>will</hi> we underſtand the things willed, or deſired, as who ſhould ſay, <hi>the good will of God</hi> is that which makes us deſire to doe in all things what is good at leaſt, <hi>his acceptable will</hi> is that which cauſeth us to doe what is yet better, <hi>his perfect will</hi> is that which moves us to doe (to our powers) what we judge ever to be beſt: But we are
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:204830:76"/> to note the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here ſpeaks of <hi>the will</hi> of ſign, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or counſell, which God hath given us to doe good by, or rather to be our rule of knowing when we doe well, but not of the <hi>will</hi> of his abſolute divine pleaſure, for that is ſo neceſſary, as nothing can be done againſt it, that is to ſay, nothing can be done otherwiſe, than as God is pleaſed it ſhall be; but the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates himſelf about theſe three Wills, deſcribing the <hi>good will,</hi> from the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this Chapter, to conſiſt in being ſoberly wiſe, and to proceed according to the meaſure of grace given us by God, each in our calling: The <hi>acceptable</hi> he deſcribes from the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe to the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, making that to conſiſt in a ſincere cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all affection in a ſervent, ſtrong, and liberall love to our neighbours. <hi>The perfect</hi> from the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe to the end of the Chapter, he ſayes conſiſteth in a perfect love, mixt with ſo much humility, as makes us condeſcend to love even our enemies, and doe good to them, though they requite us again with ill offices done to us.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. St <hi>Paul</hi> here profeſſeth his knowledge of ſpirituall things not to be otherwiſe in him, then by the ſpeciall <hi>grace of God,</hi> given him to know thus much as he doth, yet it is moſt probable be alluded to the particular <hi>grace</hi> of his Apoſtolate, which gave him the ſcience to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſpirits, and that he profeſſeth to doe in theſe three gradations of the will divine, which here hee makes, and if in this place we underſtand <hi>grace</hi> for power given unto him to inſtruct them by office as he was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, it might (ſo taken) bee no wreſted ſenſe: By bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us not <hi>to bee more wiſe than becomes,</hi> he adviſeth mediocrity in all proceedings, and diſſwades from exceſs or extreams in any kinde; ſince even at the extremity of vertue, vice attends; or hee may forbid curioſities in points of Faith, ſuch as brinke upon hereſie, when they are too far ſtrained: Or laſtly, he may forbid in theſe words, pride and vain glory, or ſelf-conceit in men, of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:204830:77"/> their own ablities, when they value themſelves at a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rate than others doe, or then indeed they can deſerve: For this is to be <hi>wiſer than they ought,</hi> this is not to be ſoberly, but impudently wiſe. Hee ſayes further, That <hi>every one</hi> ſhould proceed according as God hath <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the meaſure of Faith,</hi> that is to ſay, according as God hath given his ſeverall gifts for imbelliſhment unto the true Faith of Chriſt, or as graces thereunto belonging, but ſo as they muſt be <hi>gratis</hi> given, and as certain Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the true Faith: Such were the gifts of <hi>tongues,</hi> of <hi>prophecie,</hi> of <hi>diſcretion of Spirits,</hi> of <hi>Interpretation of Scripture,</hi> of <hi>teaching,</hi> of <hi>miniſtery,</hi> and the like 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 10. and while any one had received theſe gratuit gifts, <hi>as meaſures of his Faith,</hi> or as Teſtimonies that he was a true Chriſtian, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> adviſeth him to reſt there, and not to undertake <hi>teaching,</hi> if he were but gifted to the <hi>miniſtery,</hi> nor <hi>diſcernment</hi> of ſpirits, if he had onely the gift of <hi>tongues,</hi> and ſo of the reſt.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:204830:84"/> this Prayer and the other parts of this dayes Service, we ſhall hardly find it in any member or word of the Prayer, where yet (if at all) it muſt be found.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:204830:84"/> but ſpirituall men avoid, God moderating fleſhly appetites in them, ſo as they ſhall not intrench upon ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall duties, but give way to ſerving God, though with abridgement of their own delights: and this is done, when Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> counſell is followed, <hi>Let thoſe that have wives be as if they had none,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 29.

                           <p>IN regard there was reference made to this place on Sunday laſt concerning <hi>the rule of Faith,</hi> therefore we ſhall here take hold of the laſt part of this verſe firſt, and having premiſed what is peculiarly neceſſary upon this which is hugely controverſiall, we ſhall then proceed in our wonted manner for expounding the reſt of the Text. We are therefore here to note, That by the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> is not underſtood, onely the Apoſtles Creed, branched into twelve Articles, as we have received it from age to age, but a ſet Form of life delivered by word of mouth unto the People by the Apoſtles, who had firſt held Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels about it amongſt themſelves, and ſtood reſolved,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:204830:86"/> all their teaching ſhould be conformable thereunto. And this <hi>Rule</hi> is not (as Hereticks will have it) the holy Scripture written by the Apoſtles, for this <hi>Rule</hi> was made long before any Scripture was written, and it was never delivered abroad but by word of mouth in their preaching and exhortations: ſo it is properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Apoſtolicall Tradition, which is yet, even unto this very day, the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> to the whole Catholick Church, to the Decrees of all Councels, to the ſenſe or expoſition of the holy Scriptures, and conſequently Scripture cannot be (as Hereticks pretend) the ſole <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> though true it is, there muſt be nothing (nor is there any thing at all) in holy Writ contrary to <hi>this Rule,</hi> or Apoſtolicall Tradition; which was much larger than the written Word, and therefore it ever was (and ſtill is) even to the ſacred Word, a kind <hi>of Rule</hi> or Teſt to try it by, ſince before the Apoſtles iſſued out their written books of Scripture, thoſe books were examined by this <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which was framed by common conſent of the whole number or Colledge of Apoſtles; whereas all of them did not write, nay, two onely of the twelve were Evangeliſts, or Writers of the Goſpels, for Saint <hi>Mark</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke</hi> (the other two Evangeliſts) were not dignified with the ſtile of Apoſtolate, though they were all Preachers of the Goſpel, according ſtill to this <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> kept cloſe amongſt themſelves: And indeed the Evangeliſts writ their Goſpels rather upon Emergencies than upon any deſign or command they had from Chriſt ſo to doe; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring with Hereſies, they did beat them down, not onely by preaching, but even by writing, as ſince the Doctours and Fathers of the Church have done in all ages: yet this difference there is betwen the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the <hi>Fathers</hi> writings, that the former are more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſteriall, more oracular, more authoritative than the latter; for however we attribute much to any one Father,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:204830:86"/> yet if another Father write contrary, we regulate our ſelves then by the conſent of Fathers, whereas it is not ſo in any of the Evangeliſts writings, or any Canonicall part of Scripture, every book, every chapter, every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, every word, every letter thereof is ſacred, and of uncontrouled, undoubted, indeed of ſacred Authority, both by reaſon of the Authors prerogative Apoſtolate, and of the ſpeciall inſtinct they had from the Holy Ghoſt to write upon ſuch occaſions as to them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.</p>
                           <p>Now to our uſuall gloſs upon the Text: In theſe Three firſt verſes of the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> enumerates <hi>the gifts</hi> proper to Church-men, according to this <hi>rule of Faith.</hi> From the ninth verſe forwards he recounts what even the lay-people ought to beg of God for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhment or <hi>meaſure of Faith,</hi> according to the <hi>rule thereof,</hi> concerning all faithfull Believers whatſoever, and though many take <hi>prophecy</hi> for a common gift, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed as well upon the Laicks as upon Eccleſiaſticall perſons, yet in this place the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> takes it ſtrictly, as appertaining to their prophetick, by which is underſtood, their preaching and teaching Function.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. For we read in holy Writ, where the Miniſtery or Diaconate was ſet apart by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as hindring them from teaching and preaching, and conferred on Deacons aſſigned ſpecially for that purpoſe: <hi>Non eſt equum, It is not reaſon</hi> (ſay the <hi>Apoſtles, Acts</hi> 6. v. 2) <hi>that we leave the word of God, and ſerve Tables. Conſider therefore, Brethren, ſeven men of you of good Teſtimony, full of the Holy Ghoſt and wiſdome, whom we may appoint over this Buſineſſe; But we will be inſtant in prayer and the miniſtery of the word.</hi> The like diviſion is made 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. where under the name of Biſhops he includes Paſtors and Preiſts too; under the name of Deacons he includes all Church-Officers below them too: So under the ſtile of <hi>prophecies,</hi> he includes two ſorts of Preiſts, <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
                              <pb n="102" facs="tcp:204830:87"/> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as alſo Paſtors and Preachers, which are Prieſts, and thoſe that by office take care of ſouls, and that of Deacons we ſhall likewiſe ſee divided anon.</p>
                           <p>Note here by <hi>faith,</hi> is not onely underſtood an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Article of <hi>faith,</hi> but a perfect underſtanding the ſence of the divine word, bee it written, or delivered from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by word of mouth; and this <hi>Faith</hi> is that which is recounted as a gratuit or free gift of the holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 9 <hi>To another is given Faith in the ſame ſpirit;</hi> ſo he ſayes here, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and others had <hi>the gift of prophecie,</hi> as a <hi>meaſure</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> that is, to explicate the ſacred word, according to the rule of faith: ſo none could uſe this gift, to vent any their own brain-ſick fictions, but onely thereby to illuſtrate the rule <hi>of Faith</hi> left unto the Church by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and conſerved as a ſacred Tradition amongſt the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> whilſt they lived, and ſo handed over from age to age unto the Church, untill the worlds end. S <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> will have this <hi>gift of prophecie,</hi> or (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here means) of <hi>Teaching,</hi> to be ſuch as renders the Preacher able to deliver high myſteries of Faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>meaſure</hi> of every true Chriſtians capacity or underſtanding; and indeed prophecy is here taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for a gift of teaching, according to the exact <hi>rule of Faith,</hi> even when the deepeſt Myſteries are agitated, or the hardeſt places of Scripture are controverted: Now by this, and what we ſaid laſt Sunday, when the third verſe of this 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> was expounded, we ſee the difference between the <hi>meaſure</hi> and the <hi>rule of Faith.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="7">7. By <hi>Miniſtery</hi> is here underſtood as above, the Diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, either as it imports the office it ſelf, or the execution thereof, as ſhall be more at large expreſſed in the next verſe: Suffice it here to know the office is taken for an externall duty of charity; and that as well corporall as ſpirituall, whereas Doctorat or <hi>prophecie,</hi> imported onely the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all exhibition of charity by Teaching, Preaching, or the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:204830:87"/> like: but the gift of Prophecie or Doctorate hath two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: The one is of ſtrict, ſolid, and Magiſterial doctrine, according to the <hi>meaſure and rule of Faith,</hi> a gift not impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every man, but rarely to ſome few, and that is here inſiſted upon only, The other is, of <hi>exhorting</hi> as followes:</p>
                           <p n="8">8. This ſeems a gift that allowes a liberty to the Preacher of perſwading to truth by any lawfull art, or meanes of Rhetorick and eloquence, to draw the hearer to a content, (as well as a conſent) of what is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; So that this <hi>exhortation</hi> is properly that which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours are to mix with their adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and doctrinall points in their Sermons, that the people may thereby be raiſed up as well to Acts of Love perfecting their will, as to Knowledge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting their underſtanding: And in this place the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> adviſeth all men thus gifted to make uſe thereof according to the <hi>meaſure and rule of faith,</hi> not to bury ſuch their talents without profiting others thereby, ſince here is a reduplication importing an actuall uſe of this Talent, ſaying, He that <hi>exhorts, in exhorting</hi> let him uſe his talent: As who ſhould ſay, Hee that is gifted to <hi>exhortation,</hi> let him make actuall uſe of that gift: But we are further to note, in this Verſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> explicates clearly the office of a Deacon, or Diaconate, which is Tripartite: The Firſt is, that of <hi>Almes;</hi> The next, that of <hi>Government:</hi> The third, that of <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> for tending ſick perſons: To the perfection of <hi>Alms,</hi> he requires <hi>Simplicity,</hi> ſuch as gives purely for charity, without ſelf-intereſt, and gives liberally upon all occaſions of exigence, not reſerving for the future, when there is a preſent want, but confiding in Gods providence for what is to come without any ſiniſter end, ſuch as theirs is, who give alms to tempt the poor to ſin. But chiefly this <hi>Simplicity</hi> conſiſts in a contradiſtinction againſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity or fraud, and againſt diſtinction of perſons, as ſome uſe to doe, giving rather to one than another in equall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:204830:88"/> out of a partiality of reſpect to this body rather than to that, as to an allie or acquaintance, before a ſtranger, a good or an ill natured man, or the like; which is againſt true <hi>Simplicity:</hi> for God is no <hi>accepter of perſons,</hi> Acts 10.38. To the perfection of government, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> requires <hi>carefulneſs,</hi> ſollicitude, and vigilance, and this to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and temporall government, for that of Internall and Spirituall, is the Paſtors, not the Deacons office, which office chiefly belongs indeed to Archdeacons, for though his perſonall <hi>care</hi> bee mixt with the ſpirituall Regimen of his Pariſhioners, yet it is his office to ſee his Deacons <hi>carefully</hi> adminiſter this Temporall governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein he doth imploy them.

                           <p n="9">9. See how the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> begins the Lay-mans <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> with a recommendation to him of dilection or <hi>love</hi> of his neighbour, as the principall vertue that muſt render his miniſtery acceptable to God and man: Such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> (Epiſt. 1. Chap. 3. <hi>v.</hi> 18.) mentions, ſaying; <hi>Let us not love in words onely, nor in language, but in deed, and in truth,</hi> which place will be explicated at large on the <hi>Sunday</hi> within the <hi>Octaves</hi> of <hi>Corpus Chriſti;</hi> Whereunto is here added a <hi>hatred of evill</hi> in thoſe wee love, and a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall adheſion or <hi>cleaving</hi> to their good example, if any ſuch

                           <p n="11">11.

Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> explicates this place, as exhorting us to meaſure our ſelves by our neighbours, rather than to reduce them to our defective proportions: but <hi>Origen</hi> (and he indeed in this place better than any) will have the ſenſe of it to be thus; that is, wiſhing to your neighbour in all things, as to your ſelf, and averting from him, what you would not have fall upon your own head: and here we are to note, that as from the nineth Verſe to the twelfth, the Apoſtle told us, what Chriſtian dilection was, ſo from thence, to this place, he proceeds to tell us, how that Love is advanced, or promoted; firſt, by <hi>hope</hi> of eternall Glory; next, by <hi>patience</hi> in Adverſity; then by inceſſant <hi>Prayers:</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by <hi>Hoſpitality</hi> to all perſons, Friends or Foes; chiefly, by this his laſt advice of <hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:204830:92"/> becauſe S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking of him, ſayes, <q>Our Lord called <hi>John,</hi> from the fluctuating time of marriage,</q> which yet may as well bee interpreted from his marriageable age, for that indeed is the fluctuating time of man, when he ebbs and flows in carnall deſires, according to emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of temptations, more importune at that age than at any other time of his life: and truly S. <hi>John</hi> ſeems to have been the favourite of Chriſt, rather by reaſon of his ſingular love to chaſtity, than for any thing elſe, ſo it is likely he never thought of marriage, whence it is more probably conjectured that this was S. <hi>Simons</hi> wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, who upon the miracle wrought thereat, of turning water into wine, left his wife (by conſent) and became an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> if yet he might not afterwards bee called to the Apoſtolate, though married, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> was. The place of this wedding is ſaid to be in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> to ſhew it was not that other <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Sidonis,</hi> which alſo was in <hi>Galilee,</hi> within the Tribe of <hi>Aſer,</hi> whereas this was within the Tribe of <hi>Zebulon,</hi> three daies journey onely from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> lying in lower <hi>Galilee</hi> and the other in the higher, out of which latter place it was that the daughter of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanaean</hi> came, whom our Saviour afterwards diſpoſſeſſed of the Devill, pittifully tormenting her, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 22. And it ſtands with reaſon, this ſhould be the wedding of <hi>Simon</hi> (Nephew to the mother of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> by marriage at leaſt) for he was the ſon of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> a <hi>Chananaean,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the husband of the B. <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> ſince the text ſeems to ſay, <hi>Ieſus his mother</hi> was the principall gueſt, and that for her ſake, <hi>Ieſus</hi> was <hi>alſo called with his Diſciples</hi>

As Couſin-Germane to the Bride-groom S. <hi>Simon,</hi> but with ſpeciall providence of God: Firſt, to honour his kinſman with his preſence; next to countenance the Nuptials of poor people, for theſe were no other, that had but little wine to make good cheer withall, ſince upon the fail thereof, Chriſt miraculouſly made more, as here
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:204830:92"/> the Goſpel tels us: Laſtly, that by this miracle he might confirm his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the belief of his being the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which wrought ſo far upon them, as it is credible St. <hi>Simon</hi> left his Spouſe to follow Chriſt, though by the preſence of Chriſt at his wedding, the Sacrament of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie was highly honoured, and made a ſacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the union between Chriſt and his Church, to beat down the <hi>Tatian</hi> and <hi>Marcion</hi> Hereſies, holding it unlawfull to marry, and by this example we find it not unfitting for Prieſts to be at Weddings modeſtly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, to put them in minde, the bond of wedlock is a ſacred thing, and ought to be knit up with ſouls affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God (even in that ſtate) above the world: As for <hi>the Diſciples</hi> here preſent, they were onely four at moſt, namely <hi>Peter, Andrew,</hi> and <hi>Phillip,</hi> not as yet purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called to the Apoſtolate, though in the Chapter above <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſayes, <hi>Chriſt bade</hi> Peter <hi>follow him,</hi> becauſe this was onely a preparation to his after calling, ſince from this Wedding <hi>Peter</hi> went to his trade again, and was from thence purpoſely called by <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon his mount with the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> numbred up in the 6. of S. <hi>Luke v.</hi> 14, 15, 16 though it is likely, <hi>Nathaniel</hi> a great devote, of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was alſo here, becauſe <hi>Philip</hi> had with much zeal brought him to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as we ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 47. who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him for a true Iſraelite, in whom there was no guile nor fraud, and the other Diſciple not named, who went with <hi>Andrew</hi> to Chriſt from <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. This Verſe ſhewes <hi>Simon</hi> was a poor man, ſince he could not provide wine enough for his wedding, whereupon the B. Virgin his Aunt, moved with the touch of humane honour, to ſee her kinſmans Nuptials diſparaged for want of Wine, and knowing her ſons power, that as God, he could doe all things, as alſo believing his Time of ſhewing himſelf to be God, was, if not come, yet at hand, preſumed to anticipate the time, out of this humane reſpect, by deſiring him to prove his Deity upon this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:204830:93"/> occaſion, of working his firſt miracle at her requeſt, to honour her husbands kindred; and yet ſee how modeſtly ſhe makes this motion, by onely telling him openly, <hi>They have no Wine,</hi> as knowing he underſtood the reſt of her meaning without more words.</p>
                           <p n="4">4, Theſe are not words of rebuke to the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> as ſome conceive, but rather of recalling her memory, and bidding her reflect, whither it be a thing for fleſh and bloud to command, or indeed expect, that God, for humane ends, ſhould ſhew his power of working a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle ſooner than of his own pleaſure he had decreed, as it ſeems this was ſooner; ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells his Mother, <hi>his hour was not yet come</hi> of declaring himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> but in regard he found there was a piety mixed with this humane reſpect of the Virgin, he diſpenſeth with the concomitant infirmty of humane nature, as long as there is a motive directly calling upon his Deity, which is that of piety: whence ſome will have it, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> onely expected till all the Wine was quite gone, to the end the miracle might be more manifeſt, when the after plenty of Wine ſhould flow from the totall privation thereof. And in this ſenſe neither was the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> much preproperous, nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> at all anteverting or preventing the time prefixed for the manifeſting of his Deity; ſince immediately after, this laſt cup of Wine was gone, and then the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> knowing happily by his all-reavealing aſpect what would follow.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. She ſayes to the Servants, <hi>Doe whatſeover he ſhall ſay to you</hi> without diſpute, for his word is ſufficient to effect, what ere he pleaſeth to have done.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The reaſon why ſpeciall mention is made here, of <hi>water-pots of Stone</hi> is, becauſe what was to be filled out of them might be manifeſtly known to be nothing but water, ſince Wine was never put into ſuch great veſſels, eſpecially at ſuch poor peoples feaſts as theſe, ſo finding thoſe <hi>water-pots</hi> to run Wine, the miracle
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:204830:93"/> might appear the greater and more manifeſt. Though beſides this, the Text tells us here of the cuſtome among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to have great Jarrs of water alwayes ready, in caſe they had touched any unclean meat, at the Table, to waſh their hands immediately; and for this reſpect it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe pots were according to the purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Jewes:</hi> and theſe were veſſels of ſuch bulke, as probably <hi>ſix of them,</hi> containing each four gallons or thereabouts, held as much as a large veſſell of Wine, to ſhew the miracle the more undoubted, that ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity ſhould be afforded them ſo ſuddenly, who had not one drop left before.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. It ſeems therefore, though theſe great veſſels of water were brought in, they were not filled, but had each of them ſome quantity within them, wherefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> to take away all colour of deceit, firſt bids all thoſe veſſels <hi>to be filled full of water up to the top,</hi> that ſo each perſon in the room might ſee the certainty of the miracle, and the liberality of God, when he pleaſeth to open his bounteous hand unto us.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. This done, <hi>Jeſus</hi> bids them <hi>draw</hi> of the veſſels full of water a cup full, <hi>and carry it to the cheif Steward</hi> of the feaſt, becauſe he could beſt tell, whether or not he had provided that plenty, and ſuch rare Wine, as thoſe pots full of water did afford. For it was the Jewiſh cuſtome ever to have ſome modimperatour or prefect of good order at ſuch feaſts, ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of firſt taſting this cup of grace; and the preſence of ſuch a prefect makes the company of <hi>Ieſus</hi> and his Mother more avowable at the feaſt, ſince where a prefect of good order was, there could be no ſuſpition at all of the leaſt exceſs or diſorder.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. This verſe ſhewes us, the modimperatour having found Wine come in, more than he had appointed, and knowing none durſt provide any beſides himſelf, unleſs by chance the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> took the priviledge ſo to doe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:204830:94"/> (which yet was not uſuall) preſently calls to him, ſaying to this effect.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. This is beyond the ordinary courſe two wayes, firſt, that you have more Wine than I was privy too; next, that you have reſerved to the laſt <hi>your beſt Wine,</hi> for this is ſingular good, much better than what we had before.

                           <p>IT is remarkable to ſee how negatively Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this dayes Epiſtle minds us of being ſinners, when
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:204830:95"/> poſitively he exhorts us to be Saints with the <hi>Romans;</hi> for what greater ſigne, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> found a world of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in the Romans, than that he ſtirs them up ſo much to Vertues contrary to the vices they abound in; and thus the Epiſtle inſiſting all upon vertues, is well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the Goſpell, running all upon infirmities, myſtically repreſenting vices: for what elſe doth the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall leproſie of the Leper, or the paraliticall diſeaſe of the Centurions boy purport, than the like ſcurvy latent diſeaſes of ſin in our Souls, to thoſe which were apparent in theſe two bodies? Whence it was but fitting this dayes Prayer ſhould beg to have the ſame <hi>right hand</hi> of God <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> over us, which was the cure of theſe temporall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, types of our ſpirituall infirmities: nor can we hope this will be done, unleſs God of his infinite goodneſs be <hi>propitious</hi> to us, and therefore we beſeech him in the Prayer, firſt to <hi>look propitiouſly on our infirmities,</hi> and then to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (to our protection) the right hand of his majeſty;</hi> that is to ſay, all his power, as if our vice required no leſs than an infinite vertue to cure it; our weakneſs, no leſs than all Heavens forces to protect us. And ſince both the Leper, and Paralitick, ſaying this Prayer (in effect) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained corporall cure thereby; why ſhould we doubt of Spirituall cure, if we ſay with like Faith, like Hope, like Love, the ſame Prayer to day: and truly, to ſay it with leſs, were a confuſion to Chriſtianity, that Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould exceed us in fervour of Piety: beſides, we have yet an eaſier task, than they, in hand, for their demands were no leſs than to have a Miracle wrought upon them, by a Phyſicall cure, without a Phyſicall cauſe, (unleſs we ſhall ſay, the touch of Chriſts hand was a Phyſicall cure for all diſeaſes) whereas we onely demand a favour, not a miracle, a little Grace to blot out a great deal of Sin; and though it be a greater effect to remit ſin of the Soul, than to cure diſeaſes of the Body; yet this will not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, as the other was, and conſequently, if we ask
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:204830:96"/> a favour with like zeal, as they did beg a Miracle, ſurely we may hope to have it, and truly not to ask it, is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to deſerve it, but to confound our ſelves, knowing it is but <hi>Ask</hi> and <hi>Have,</hi> with ſo good, ſo puiſſant, ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful a God. And thus we ſee again, there is a deeper ſenſe latent in the Prayers of holy Church, than lazy Souls (that will not meditate it out) can eaſily retrive; but once found out, muſt needs prove hugely conſonant unto the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> and <hi>Goſpell</hi> of the day, ſince holy Church gives us this Prayer for an abſtract of her doctrine in the Pulpit, that ſo we may <hi>unanimouſly,</hi> and <hi>with one mouth honour God, and</hi> (whom he ſent) our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

THis <hi>Epiſtle</hi> begins with the end of the ſeventeenth Verſe, the beginning being explicated in the laſt <hi>Sundayes Epiſtle;</hi> nor is there any thing of moment can be ſaid more, than the Text it ſelf ſpeaks, diſſwading us <hi>to render evill for evill,</hi> but exhorting to <hi>provide</hi> as much <hi>good</hi> as we can to all men: which Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> explicates, as alluding to converſation, and counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it may be good, both in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> ſaying, <hi>We owe our Conſciences to God, our Fame to Man,</hi> though perhaps this may be an addition of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the former part of the Counſell, as who ſhould ſay, we were not onely to avoid <hi>rendring evill for evill;</hi> but rather inſtead of ſo doing, to repay an ill turn done unto us with a good deed done by us, to thoſe that doe us hurt</p>
                           <p n="18">18. And to that purpoſe the next Verſe alludes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>If it may be;</hi> for perhaps all the good we can doe, will not gain upon our enemeis, at leaſt we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour on our part there be no defect, but that (if poſſible) we be <hi>at peace with all men,</hi> as we deſire God to be in <hi>peace</hi> with us, and not to wage againſt us the warre of his wrath and fury, ſince we offend him hourly, and that infinitely more, than any enemy we have can offend us.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. The Latine phraſe is not <hi>defending your ſelves,</hi> but becauſe commonly the defenſe of Man againſt Man is made by way of <hi>Revenge,</hi> therefore here the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> ſenſe is extended thereunto, as if what reſiſtance we may make under the moderation of an unbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med defence muſt be ſure to ſavour nothing of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> if we will hold the integrity of a good Chriſtians reputation: but inſtead of <hi>Revenging, give place to wrath;</hi> that is, as ſome will have it, to the Divine Wrath,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:204830:97"/> which is provoked in God againſt all thoſe that doe injury to any one of his creatures, as Princes take the wrong done to their Miniſters for affronts to them, and ſo <hi>revenge</hi> the ſame; others ſay, to be ſilent, to depart, when you are exaſperated, is to <hi>give place to wrath.</hi> The laſt and beſt meaning is, if your enemy begin to be angry, oppoſe him not, but let him go on till his anger be over; and this, as it is truly to give way or <hi>place to wrath;</hi> ſo oftentimes it is the means to appeaſe the fury of the Enemy, who (if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted) might increaſe in fury, whereas not being oppoſed, he cools within himſelf; and ſo there is double <hi>way gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> both by the receiver of a wrong, and by him that through the patience of the injured, ſurceaſeth to doe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther injury, by his further <hi>wrath:</hi> and this way is ſutable to that of our Saviour, ſaying, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. v. 29. <hi>If any ſtrike your right cheek, turn him your left,</hi> rather than ſtrike him again: So this <hi>place</hi> thus <hi>given to wrath</hi> imports as much as a pardon given to our neighbours offence againſt us, as we hope for pardon of our offences againſt God: For thus we ſhall <hi>give way,</hi> that the injurious words, paſſing through our humane ears into our Chriſtian hearts, and there bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the bowels of brotherly affection, may die, and be no more remembred, than if they never had been heard by us, or ſpoken by our enemy: and leſt we ſhould ſay, if neither I, nor any friend elſe <hi>revenge</hi> my wrongs, I ſhall never live in quiet; therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (knowing this was an objection obvious againſt him) adds preſently what is written, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. v. 35. <hi>Revenge to me. I will reward;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, Be not, O Chriſtians, ſollicitous how to redeeme your vexation for injuries, unleſs you <hi>revenge</hi> them, be it your part to receive all wrong patiently, and leave it to God to right you; let him <hi>revenge</hi> your quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells, he both can, as omnipotent, and will, as juſt, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly <hi>revenge</hi> your wrongs, rather we ſhould pitty thoſe who <hi>fall into the hands of the living God;</hi> for that is <hi>terrible,</hi> as the Scripture ſayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Mountain he came down from,</hi> is that whereon he began his Sermon, which Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> relates from the fifth Chapter, to the Eighth, and now brings our Saviour, by his Miracles in the Vallies, confirming the Doctrine he had preached on <hi>the mountain,</hi> which ſome will have to be the mount <hi>Olivet;</hi> but others (more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably) the mount <hi>Thabor:</hi> yet moſt likely it was a <hi>Mount</hi> known by the name of <hi>our Saviours Mount,</hi> whereon he uſed much to be, either chooſing his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> out of many other of his Diſciples, or Preaching, or Praying, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within three miles of <hi>Caphernaum,</hi> where he wrought
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:204830:100"/> many Miracles, looking down upon the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and adjacent to the City of <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> a place of a gallant proſpect, round about it, ſeeing many Countries and Townes. And hither he being often wont to come pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately by himſelf, to ſpend there whole nights in Prayer, it may very well be called <hi>Ieſus his Mount,</hi> by a kind of excellency, as ſufficiently to be known by that name, when there is no diſtinction added to remark any other Mountain by, as here there is not: and ſo we may here take <hi>the Mountain,</hi> to import as much as <hi>Ieſus his Mount,</hi> ſpecially frequented by him, and celebrated abundantly, by ſo ſacred a reſort thereunto. The <hi>great Multitudes</hi> that are here ſaid <hi>to follow him,</hi> were thoſe preſent at his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon upon this <hi>Mount;</hi> ſo taken therewith, as they could not forſake him, but followed him (many of them) up and down all the Country, converſing either with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with his Diſciples, or with ſome that had been cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him; and ſo never wanting imployment of delight unto them.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Many doubt whether this cure of the <hi>Leper</hi> be the ſame which Saint <hi>Mark</hi> recounts, Chap. 1. ver. 40. and Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> Chap. 5. ver. 12 for by them it ſeemes this Miracle was not done immediately after Chriſt deſcended from the <hi>Mount,</hi> nor in the Valley near it, becauſe Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſayes it was done <hi>in a certain City;</hi> beſides, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count other Miracles before this, conſequent to Chriſt his coming down from <hi>the mountain</hi> aforeſaid, yet becauſe Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſeemes the moſt exact for the ſeries, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Sacred Hiſtory, therefore we may rather think the others ſtood not ſo preciſely upon the order, but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied themſelves to tell what was done by Chriſt, firſt or laſt. Again, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> may be underſtood to mean without the City, though he ſay the cure was done <hi>in a certain City,</hi> becauſe it was a cure upon a Citizen, whoſe diſeaſe being a Leproſie did force him out of the Town, according to the cuſtome of all ſuch foul diſeaſed perſons,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204830:100"/> to avoid the danger of infecting others; ſo it being done on, or in the Citizen, S. <hi>Luke</hi> may call it a cure done in the City, whereunto the <hi>Leper</hi> did belong; and ſuch ſpeeches are frequent, for men often ſay, we had a ſtrange cure wrought here in our City, ſuch a man for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cured thus and thus, though happily the party might bee carried out of Town to his Phyſitian or Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo we ſee a way cleer enough to avoid contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt the Evangeliſts, however their Stories may ſeem now and then not to jumpe exactly in all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as for example, they all three agree in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall expreſſions of this <hi>Lepers</hi> coming to Chriſt for cure; for whereas S. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us he came <hi>bending his knees,</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſayes <hi>falling on his face:</hi> This <hi>Adoration</hi> S <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> brings him in with, is the concluſion of both thoſe poſtures, as who ſhould ſay, he kneeling down firſt, then falling proſtrate on his face <hi>adored Jeſus,</hi> as that great God, from whom he begg'd his cure, knowing his diſeaſe was more contagious than any man could heal, and by this manner of ſpeech aſſuring himſelf it was in the power of Chriſt, while he ſaid unto him, <hi>If thou wilt, thou canſt cleanſe me</hi> of this ſcurfie <hi>Leproſie,</hi> in which words, though he ſhewed his owne deſire of cure, yet withall he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his reſignation to the divine will, ſaying, <hi>If thou wilt, thou canſt make, &amp;c.</hi> as who ſhould ſay, Gods power is equall to his will, and if thou wilt not, thy holy will be done, for thou knoweſt better what to will for mee, than I doe for my ſelf, wherefore, O Lord, as thy holy will is, bee it done with mee, but I deſire no other power at leaſt to cure mee, than thy ſacred will: Now that this was the meaning of the <hi>Lepers</hi> words, the next Verſe ſhews.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. For behold no ſooner had this creature reſigned himſelf perfectly to the <hi>will</hi> of his Creator, ſhewing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bee did love God above all things (even himſelf inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) then, (in teſtimony of that truth, ſaying <hi>to thoſe who
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:204830:101"/> love God, all things cooperate for their good)</hi> he was cured by Chriſt <hi>ſtretching forth</hi> his pureſt <hi>hand</hi> upon the impure petitioner, and ſaying, <hi>I will cure thee,</hi> ſince thou ſayeſt ſo truly, that my <hi>will</hi> is adequate unto my power: <hi>Bee thou</hi> therefore <hi>made clean</hi> of thy corporall impurity, as by Faith I ſee thou art of thy ſpirituall infidelity: But here we are to obſerve Chriſt <hi>touched the Leper;</hi> which, as it was a prevarication of the Moſaick Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. ſo it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the abrogation thereof lay in the power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who came to give a more perfect Law unto the People of God. Again, this <hi>touch</hi> was in ſigne of Benevolence; laſtly, it was happily an application of right actives to paſſives for effecting the cure, ſince the very corporall <hi>touch</hi> of Chriſt his ſacred <hi>hand,</hi> was of force to cure all diſeaſes: but the method of Chriſts words deſerveth here a ſpeciall remark: for while he ſayes <hi>I will,</hi> he confutes the hereſie of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> denying <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be God, and to have for the proof of his omnipotence, his omnivolence; that is to ſay, all things as ſubject to his Will, as to his Power; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he confutes the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie denying <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have power of himſelf, or to be God equall to his Father in power, and ſo obliged to command rather in his Fathers name, than in his own: whereas here he commands the cure as from himſelf, and in vertue of his own abſolute power ſaying. <hi>Be thou made clean:</hi> wherefore this place muſt not be read, as ſome conceive, ſaying, <hi>I will cure thee:</hi> no, but <hi>I will: Be thou cured,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, ſince thou deſireſt no greater power than my <hi>will;</hi> loe <hi>I will,</hi> what thou deſireſt; and therefore thus I command thy diſeaſe to leave thee. <hi>Be thou cleanſed.</hi>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:204830:101"/> for the Leper had uſed the ſame Phraſe, ſaying, <hi>If thou wilt, thou canſt;</hi> ſo Chriſt replyes to both, ſaying he <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>ſhewing,</hi> he <hi>can,</hi> while he commands it to be done, as was deſired; and that (as the text ſaith) immediately; for the effect of Gods <hi>will,</hi> is the work or deed, he will have to be done; and ſo there needs no <hi>medium,</hi> where the will and power are both equall, and identified, as in God all Attributes are, according to that of holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 148. ver. 5. <hi>He ſaid the word, and all things were</hi> thereby <hi>made.</hi>

I do willingly pay Love, and as willingly take it in payment: it is a thing, which when received, I count not my ſelf fully ſatisfied, nor when I repay it, diſcharged.</q> Hence we may ſee how abſurdly the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Trinitarians</hi> Hereſy exploded by this Text all debts of Juſtice, and onely required the <hi>debt of Love</hi> to ſtand due for if Charity oblige to doe ultro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and voluntary good deeds, how much more
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:204830:107"/> to do Juſtice? but ſo perfect a payment of all debts is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by this place, as we ſee the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaies, <hi>Who loveth his neighbour fulfilleth the Law,</hi> becauſe we cannot <hi>love</hi> him, but we muſt <hi>love</hi> God for himſelf, and man for God's ſake, as we <hi>love</hi> our ſelves.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. And to confute further the Hereſy above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſee how this whole verſe inſiſts upon Acts of Juſtice to our neighbour, rooted in the commanded <hi>Love</hi> to them aforeſayd: Whence ſome conceive the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> alludes onely to the law of the Second Table, becauſe here is no mention of any one of the three precepts belonging to the Firſt Table, importing our duty to God; but <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> contends, that the <hi>love</hi> of man (being but ſubordinate to the <hi>love</hi> of God, 1 <hi>John,</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 7.) imports and includes both, grounded on thoſe words of <hi>S. John, Children love one another,</hi> repeated over and over againe to his friends, and being asked why he did ſo, he replied, <hi>becauſe it is the Precept of our Lord, and if this alone be done, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi> For our <hi>love</hi> to God and man, is like the lines drawn from the Center to their Circumference, be the Center God, the Circle man, the Lines our affections, ſee then how they flow between theſe two extreames, the more they approach to the Circle, the wider they are; but as they recede from the Circle, the cloſer they go, till at laſt they are all concentred in one point, Almighty God; and ſo made one heart and one ſoule amongſt our ſelves; hence we ſee, that all the motion our affections have from man to God, growes ſtill more and more vigorous and more perfect: So <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> concludes, DILIGE, ET FAC QUOD VIS. <hi>Love, and do what thou pleaſe. (Tract.</hi> 7. in Epiſt. 1. <hi>S. John.</hi>) whereas the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes, <hi>if there be any other precept</hi> (meaning of the Second Table) for of the three belonging to the Firſt Table, and that of honouring our parents, (the firſt precept of the Second Table) he had ſpoken before at large, under the title of Superiour pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Princes and others, ending that ſubject in theſe words,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:204830:108"/> 
                              <hi>To whom honour honour:</hi> for that command is in theſe words <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother,</hi> under which title are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, Elders, Betters, Superiours, eſpecially Princes, ſpoken of at large from the firſt verſe of this Chapter to the end of the ſeventh, ending as above, <hi>to whom honour, honour:</hi> I ſay whereas the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaies, <hi>if there be any other Precept, it is included in this word, Love your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as your ſelfe,</hi> we are to note the <hi>Precept of love to our neighhour</hi> is bipartite, as divided into two branches, the firſt whereof is affirmative, grounded on theſe words of <hi>S. Matth. Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>What you will have others doe to you, doe you the ſame to them.</hi> The ſecond negative, in that of <hi>Tobit, Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>What you hate to have another doe to you, ſee you never do that to another:</hi> not that this Precept commands an equality, but onely a ſimilitude of <hi>love</hi> to your neighbour, with that you beare to your ſelf, that is to ſay, as all you deſire is honeſt, good, delectable to your ſelfe, ſo deſire the like to your neighbour, not in equall proportion but in exact ſimilitude, diſtaſte him not, hurt him not, rob him not, as you deſire he ſhould not, diſtaſte, hurt, nor rob you: ſo the alluſion is to ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude not to equality.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. The reaſon of this is becauſe the object of our <hi>love</hi> being good, the effect thereof muſt be good alſo; for as none can <hi>love</hi> evill for evills ſake, ſo none can <hi>love</hi> good for evills ſake, becauſe true <hi>love</hi> both makes good the end and medium of its operation: as who ſhould ſay, doe I finally ayme at good, then good muſt be the medium lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto; ſo it being good to <hi>love</hi> our neighbour, the operation of this good <hi>love,</hi> cannot be a bad thing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> concludes, <hi>The fullneſſe of the Law is Love,</hi> that is to ſay, if we <hi>love,</hi> we fulfill the Law: or as <hi>Tolet</hi> ſaies, <q>
                                 <hi>The ſcope or end of the Law is Love,</hi> or as <hi>S. Auguſtine, becauſe love forceth a man to fulfill the Law,</hi>
                              </q> hence we ſee, Faith alone ſufficeth not to ſatisfie the Law without Acts of <hi>Love;</hi> how abſurd is it then to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:204830:108"/> ſay as hereticks do, the Commandements are impoſſible to be kept, when by onely <hi>love</hi> they are all fulfilled: not that ſo perfect a <hi>love</hi> can here be hoped for, as ſhall exempt us from veniall ſinnes againſt the Law, (ſince ſuch is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſerved for the next world, and performed in the ſtate of Bliſs) but that we may forbeare mortall ſin, even in this life, if <hi>we but love our neighbour,</hi> as our ſelves, and God (appretiatively at leaſt) above all things, that is to ſay, not ſo well to <hi>love</hi> any thing, but ſtill to reſolve we will rather leave to <hi>love</hi> it, than for its ſake ceaſe to <hi>love</hi> God; and ſurely thus all good Chriſtians doe appretia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively <hi>Love God above all things.</hi>

S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> words are theſe, <hi>If any will contend the Apoſtles were meant by theſe</hi> men, <hi>wee muſt ſay they were ſo called, becauſe they did not yet know the power of our Saviour;</hi> and certainly if they were ignorant of it, they did not believe it, ſo they deſerved not, (in this conjunction of things) the ſuperlative ſtile or dignity of the Apoſtolate: but in very truth the following words ſhew by <hi>theſe men</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> meant the marriners and ſtrangers to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that were in the ſhip, whileſt he makes them ſay. <hi>What a man is this, that the winds and ſea obey him?</hi> This was a language not likely to come out of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> mouthes, even in the <hi>admiring</hi> ſence of the words, admit we take them not in the Interrogatory mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof onely; For had the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> made this <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> in words, ſurely they would have been ſo civill, as to ſay, how happy are we, that ſerve a maſter, who is of ſuch admirable power? but to ſay, <hi>What an one,</hi> or, <hi>What a man is this,</hi> who hath ſuch power over winds and ſeas, is rather the language of a rude ſtranger, than of a civill freind, or dutifull ſervant, and conſequently could not probably be meant of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by the Evangeliſt.</p>

But if it pleaſe God, we have it once expounded unto us, that we may underſtand it in a ſafe and ſound ſenſe, then not to read it, will be a fault, whereas till then to read it, may prove a danger to us: and in very truth one reaſon why I have undertaken to ſet forth this book, was to give the Lay-people a little liberty in reading, at leaſt all the Epiſtles and Goſpels throughout the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes of the year, when they were laid open to them in a ſafe ſenſe, ſuch as might (nay, muſt needs) ediſie, and can no wayes offend, or cauſe dangers to the reader: ſo to read, and poſſeſſe themſelves of thus much Scripture, as is here delivered in the flux of a year unto then, muſt needs be highly commendable, and hugely profitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every one that reads, and makes it their ſtudy, indeed their Prayer from one end of the year to the other; for ſo ſhall they have abundance, or ſtore enough of Scripture for them to be able inwardly to abound withall, and to conferre wiſely thereupon with one another, nay, even to teach themſelves, if the Prieſt fail to doe it, how to ſquare their actions according to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the Law of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the inſtinct of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the rule of his immediate ſubſtitutes, the Paſtours of holy Church, whoſe preaching may be more ample, but muſt not be to other ſenſe, than what they find delivered to be the true meaning of the holy Scriptures: ſo ſhall they be ever <hi>in grace, ſinging, &amp;c.</hi> that is in thankſ-giving to God, for having received thus much of his holy Word expounded

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:204830:121"/> things, I doe not well know: ſure I am reaſon alwaies dictates to doe well, and as ſure I am, that a ſinne is an irrationall act, as it is certainely a thing ill done: nay, if I had ſaid, every ſinne were ſo farre forth againſt nature, as it is againſt reaſon, I think I ſhould not exceed verity in that aſſertion; and ſince all that men doe like men, they premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, therefore with reaſon we pray this day (leaſt our actions ſhould prove unnaturall that our meditations or thoughts ſhould be rational, for none other are connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to men, as men, though often they creep upon us, and ſo render our actions more beſtiall than rationall, more unnaturall than naturall. To conclude, though many of our actions paſſe among men as rationall, which yet are not ſo indeed, therefore we pray to day, that really they may be ſo, ſince God is not deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as man is, and ſince no unreaſonable thought or deed can paſſe with him for reaſon, or <hi>be pleaſing to him:</hi> ſee then if it be not very fitting to pray that corrupted Nature, may (by Grace) be elevated to the operations ſuiting Nature in her beſt rectitude, when even ſo, ſhe is crooked enough in the ſight of God, who is <hi>Rectitude Eſſentiall.</hi> But leaſt, while we condeſcend to ſatisfie curioſity, we forget our maine deſigne, let us ſee how this Prayer ſuits indeed with the other parts of this daies ſervice, which with the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> it ſeemes to doe, whileſt petitioning <hi>Reaſon</hi> to be the guide of all our actions, it puts us in mind of a rationall perſiſting to doe well, ſince by Gods grace we are called with the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to the profeſſion of the ſame faith, which this daies <hi>Epiſtle</hi> from firſt to laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to continue in, maugre the intervening perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, that may divert them from it; And look what was then ſaid to them for perſeverance both in faith and good workes, is alſo to day by holy Church applied to us in this <hi>Prayer,</hi> that beggs us grace ever to think,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:204830:122"/> and conſequently alwaies to doe well, that is, <hi>reaſonable things,</hi> becauſe none elſe can be <hi>pleaſing</hi> to Almighty God. It remaines onely to ſhew how this <hi>Prayer</hi> does alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> whereunto, it is the better ſuiting, if it be (as ſome witts will have it) paradoxicall, ſince that is wholly parabolicall, yet nothing leſſe rationall, than is the prayer, petitioning reaſon in all we think or doe: for who can deny but the <hi>little muſtard-ſeed</hi> of Gods holy word is hugely rationall? or who can ſay, but the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it falls into the earthly hearts of men, the faſter root it takes, growes the ſtronger up, and brings the riper fruit, becauſe as well, the reaſon of it, as the grace is hugely convincing. Againe, who can deny but the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the ſame word hidden in our Soules ſhall with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon operate upon the whole maſs of our bodies, and give them a taſte thereof, harſh perhaps to the corrupted pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats of worldly men, but delitious to the reliſh of God and his holy Angels, who delight to taſte of ſuch leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed loaves, as we call ſower, when they eſteeme them ſweet: and ſuch are Converts from the Court, who are (by the leaven of Gods holy word) become Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Heaven, though ſeeming Clownes to Earth. Thus myſtically have we adjuſted the parabolicall <hi>Goſpel</hi> to the paradoxicall <hi>Prayer</hi> of this day, if wits will have it to be a paradox, that men ſhould <hi>alwaies meditate on rational things,</hi> which yet when they do not, they ceaſe to be men; I will not ſay, what might follow, that <hi>they become beaſts.</hi>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:204830:124"/> but it is worthy obſervation, to ſee the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeak ſo confidently of our ſufferings here before Men, as if God, for whom theſe men did ſee us ſuffer, were as viſible in our eyes (though we ſee him not) as the men are, whom we doe ſee; and truly, ſo it is: For God is remarkably ſeen in all his creatures, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom;</hi> 1. ver. 20. <hi>The inviſibles of God, by thoſe things that are viſible,</hi> (and rightly <hi>underſtood) are ſeen unto us.</hi> And if we could alwayes have this truth in our minde, we ſhould alwayes have <hi>God</hi> before our eyes, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> avoucheth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> had, ſaying they did <hi>believe, love,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> (in the ſenſes above) as if they had <hi>God the Father,</hi> and his <hi>ſacred Son</hi> perpetually ſtanding before them, and viſibly incouraging them to all the good actions of their lives; which indeed, if every good Chriſtian ſhould perſwade himſelf, and ſquare his actions according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhould ſoon ſee a good world here, and a happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our goodneſs in the next life.</p>

The <hi>knowledge</hi> he here ſpeaks of, is not that of his Belief, and Faith, but rather of his experience: for it was an evident proof to him, that God did love thoſe whom he had <hi>Elected</hi> to the happy calling of Chriſtianity, as it was preached by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> not as now, when that terme of <hi>election</hi> is too looſely, and too largely taken, God knowes; though in truth he alludes here to his <hi>knowledge,</hi> that their <hi>Election</hi> to Glory will be the reward of their vocation to Grace, if they perſevere, as they have begun, to be good Chriſtians; ſo he ſpeaks (as by what followes appears) literally of their preſent <hi>election</hi> to Grace, myſtically, and as by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of that glory, upon condition of their perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>

In fine, it avails little which of theſe we take, the Parable is verified in them all, and indeed they are all in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner one and the ſame thing; for all have root in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and are branches of him, and the Analogie holds between the <hi>mustard ſeed</hi> and every one of theſe; for who leſſe than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was the out-caſt of men?

THE <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had in the foregoing verſes ſpoken of his diſintereſted evangelizing without the leaſt mixture of ſordid gaine for his ſo doing, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of zeale to Soules and love to God; and in this verſe he ſimilifies between an <hi>Evangelizer</hi> and <hi>one that runs a race:</hi> having firſt ſtated his buſineſſe, that the Evangelizer muſt be a man voyd of all proper Intereſt or ends, ayming onely at Gods honour, and the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soules: ſo to this purpoſe he tels us firſt litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of Evangelizers, that though all of them doe <hi>runne,</hi> yet it ſeemes not alwaies all with one ayme or end, not for one and the ſame <hi>priſe;</hi> ſome for true zeale, and they win the <hi>race,</hi> others for ſelf intereſt, and they (though continually running) yet looſe the match, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they runne by the bowe, not by the ſtring; they would fayne carry with them the compaſſe of their own deſires, and yet think to get heaven too, ſo they take perhaps more paines, and yet to leſſe, indeed, to no purpoſe. Myſtically the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> meanes the ſame of the lay-people, who all pretend to <hi>runne</hi> for the <hi>prize</hi> of heaven, but <hi>he,</hi> that is to ſay, ſuch onely winne it, who <hi>runne</hi> right on, and make no Maeanderous circles of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ends, which retard their ſpeed. And that he meanes not onely one perſon, but all ſuch as <hi>runne</hi> equally, that is to their utmoſt, all for one pure, ſimple and impermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed end, the following words avow, when he ſaies, <hi>ſo runne yee that yee may obtaine,</hi> that yee may winne the <hi>race,</hi> the <hi>prize,</hi> the kingdome of heaven, the Crown of Glory: Here he ſpeaks in the plurall number, to ſhew that heaven is not reſerved onely for the beſt of Chriſtians, but that every good Chriſtian may by <hi>running</hi> reach it, but then he muſt be alwaies <hi>running,</hi> as continually ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:204830:132"/> are, ſince the leaſt interpaulation or intermiſſion of running is to caſt ones ſelf behind, and therefore by <hi>ſo running</hi> is here meant running with all ſpeed poſſible; ſince when we doe all we can, unleſſe God reward our uttermoſt endeavours, with adding ſpirituall wings to our leaden heels, we ſhall come ſhort. Hence it is <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> ſaies very well, <hi>Not to goe forward in virtue, is to goe backward:</hi> So <hi>S. Bernard</hi> too, (<hi>Epiſt,</hi> 254.) <hi>therefore if to advance be to runne, not to runne is to looſe ground:</hi> and in the ſame place he brings in a ſimilitude of <hi>Jacobs ladder,</hi> whereon there was no angel at all ſtood ſtill, but every one was in perpetuall motion, either upwards or downwards; The aſcending Angels importing the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoules, and the deſcending the damned, whence it is that not to riſe in virtue is to fall to vice, ſhewing there is no finall medium between good and bad, between hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. Here the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> alludes to his own <hi>refraining</hi> all ſiniſter or propper intereſt in his Evangelizing, leaſt they might retard his ſpeed in that race he was running for his crown of Glory, as Racers <hi>refraine</hi> from all ſuch meats as doe obſtruct or ſhorten their wind, and feed upon thoſe things as dilate the lungs, or lengthen wind, which is of greateſt uſe for Courſers; and thus he doth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thoſe ſordid Soules, who will abridge themſelves here of many pleaſures and delights, meerely to gaine the temporall reward of popular applauſe, and yet will not refraine the leaſt of their ſenſualities, to gaine the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reward of praiſe from God and Angels: but if we ſhall gather one principle which will ſerve to all purpoſes in this kind, let us here fix our eyes upon <hi>temperance,</hi> as moſt conducing to healthy and vigorous ſoules, as take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away all luſtfull humours, and ſupplying us with chaſt ſpirits, that render our ſoules ſound, agil, active and victorious.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. See how prettily <hi>S. Paul</hi> compares ſiniſter ends in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:204830:132"/> Gods ſervice to men at cuffs with <hi>the ayre,</hi> or running at hazard whether they ſhall win or looſe, that is by mixing humane, with divine ends, by rayling at the world and the devill, as if they were our onely enemies, and yet pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering the body, which is indeed mans greateſt adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in regard neither of the other two can hurt us, if we be ſure the body be ſubdued. Becauſe we are not tempted as angels by pure intellectual motives, but by ſenſual or corporeall ones.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. And that this was the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſence in the verſe above, ſee how he now ſpeakes in clear termes to the ſame purpoſe, ſaying, <hi>I chaſtize my body, and bring it into ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude,</hi> as if that were indeed the maine enemy a man had, and truely ſo it is: <hi>for nothing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the ſoule or underſtanding, but firſt it muſt paſſe the ſentinels of our outward ſences,</hi> and they, if loyall, will keep out all ſinne whatſoever, but if corrupted or treacherous to their ſovereigne, the ſoule, then they wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any traytour ſent by the world or the devill to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize their Prince: and indeed all reſiſtance to forreigne enemies is vayne, if we firſt ſubdue not our domeſtick foe, our own <hi>bodies,</hi> by forcing them to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of reaſon; for unl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:204830:133"/> onely a correction or ſlight rebuke, but an abſolute ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing or captivating of it to the ſoules command, by faſting, prayer, and other corporall auſterities, as haire-ſhirts, diſciplines, or worſe tormenting inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuch as holy men have taught us the wholſome uſe of upon all notable occaſions of temptations or dangers to the ſoule: nay, theſe meanes the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> uſed amidſt his greateſt ſpirituall labours, leaſt as he ſayd, while he <hi>preached to others,</hi> he might <hi>himſelf become, reprobate,</hi> by the aſſault of pride or vain-glory; how much more then oght thoſe to mortifie their bodies, who do not waſt them in ſpirituall indeavours, as <hi>S, Paul</hi> did: but above all how fondly do Hereticks ſhake off the uſe of corporal mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, the exerciſe of good works, under pretence of Faith alone to be ſufficient? when the greateſt maſter of Spirit in the world, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> dares not hold himſelf by Faith ſecure without good works, much leſſe did he boaſt, as they doe, of a revelation, that he ſhould be ſaved, noe nor relye upon his being confirmed in grace, but <hi>wrought his ſalvation with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> which did accompany his hope, not his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption thereof. Heare <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi> how he ſpeaks againſt hereticks oppoſing this doctrine, and practiſe of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Vercellan</hi> Church, <hi>I hear</hi> (ſaith this Doctor-Father) <hi>ſome men ſay, there is no merit of abſtinence, and that thoſe are mad, who chaſtize their bodies, to make them ſubject to their ſoules, which certainly Saint</hi> Paul <hi>had never done, if he had held it to be madneſſe.</hi> To the ſame effect all the reſt of the Fathers abound with like ſentences, which for brevity ſake I omit to tranſcribe, but not to admoniſh the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an reader of, eſpecially the hereticks, whom it moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes: I ſay not who they be, leaſt I offend perſons, while I onely oppoſe their errors, cut of charity to them, and zeale of their ſoules ſalvation.</p>

                              <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Here the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſeems to divert
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:204830:133"/> from the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but indeed makes this ſeeming diverſion an approach to them againe, whileſt he puts them in mind, that it is not onely Faith with <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor to be baptized with Chriſtians, will ſuffice to get the goale of heaven, unleſſe we run continually thither upon the ſpeed of our perpetuall good works: for, ſaith he, <hi>I will not have you ignorant that our Fathers,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the children of the Synagogue, the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not Faith, nor the figurative Baptiſme <hi>of the cloud and the red Sea,</hi> types of our true Baptiſme; yet becauſe they did murmur at God, and ſinne in the deſart, deſerting thereby the neceſſary adjunct of good works, to merit their arrivall at the land of promiſe, of ſix hundred thouſand, onely two men, <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> did arrive at, and enter the ſaid land: In like manner Chriſtians, be they never ſo firme in their Faith, never ſo deepely dipt in the true Baptiſme <hi>of the red ſea</hi> of Chriſts paſſion, unleſſe they hold on the ſpeed of good works, while they are running the race to the heavenly <hi>Canaan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>,</hi> they ſhall never enter that heavenly land of promiſe, which is the price they runne for. But we are here to note how <hi>Calvin</hi> corrupts this place of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> ſaying, the <hi>Jewes</hi> received no leſſe the truth and ſubſtance of Chriſt and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits in their umbratile and figurative Sacraments onely, than we Chriſtians do in our reall Sacraments, which are the true ſubſtance of the Jewiſh ſhadowes. For the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth not ſay, they and we eat all one meate, but that all they among themſelves did eat of the figurative body of Chriſt, the Manna in their deſart raining down upon them, and drank of his figurative bloud, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters flowing out of the rock ſtrucken by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a Type of the bloud and water, the matter of our truer meates, iſſuing out of our Saviours ſide, peirced by <hi>Longinus,</hi> as Jeſus hung upon the croſſe: <hi>The cloud</hi> here mentioned is that we read of <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. ſhadowing them in the day from the ſcorching Sun, and ſhining like

                           <p n="2">2. Note this verſe doth not aſſert the <hi>Jewes</hi> to have been <hi>baptized in Moſes,</hi> as in a ſigne of their beliefe in the Moſaick Law, but that by this precedent miraculous kind of Baptiſme, they were induced after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to believe in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="3">3. We were told in the expoſition of the firſt verſe of this Chapter, that they did <hi>all eat the ſame</hi> figurative <hi>food,</hi> onely with us, that is Manna, wich was a figure of Chriſts body, our ſpiritual food in the Sacrament of the holy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, not his reall body as we doe: ſo the true ſence of this place is, that as they all did eat one figurative bread, and had one faith in God, ſo doe we; but yet, as their faith and food did not carry them all to <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo will not faith alone car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This verſe is harder than the former, in regard it will not be eaſy to ſhew, how they <hi>drank</hi> of that <hi>rock that followed them,</hi> unleſſe we allow they drank of Chriſts bloud as well as we now doe, ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> is truely <hi>the rock that did follow them,</hi> or came after them, and iſſued out his pretious bloud for us really to drink; againe <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a ſpiritual <hi>rock,</hi> as here is ſaid, not a reall rock of ſtone: for the true underſtanding therefore of this place, we muſt know by <hi>ſpirituall rock</hi> is here underſtood a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or typicall rock, and ſuch was the reall and naturall <hi>rock</hi> out of which <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded water with a ſtroak of his rod; and yet that reall rock was but a myſtery, type, or figure of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo in regard of that myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is called here <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> becauſe it did praefigure the <hi>rock of Chriſt:</hi> ſome therefore ſay with the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> that this <hi>rock</hi> did miraculouſly follow the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> even to the land of Promiſe, grounded in that text, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Others conceive this to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the water of the <hi>rock</hi> following the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at leaſt till they came where plenty of more water was; others think <hi>following them</hi> is veryfied by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the <hi>rock</hi> ſhewed to iſſue out water once at <hi>Moſes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſo by <hi>follow</hi> they underſtand <hi>obey,</hi> but this falls ſhort of the gramatticall ſignification of the word <hi>follow:</hi> ſo the true and genuine ſence of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is, that this <hi>rock</hi> as it was a type of Chriſt, ſo the <hi>following</hi> of this <hi>rock</hi> is typicall and not reall, Spiritual and not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as who ſhould ſay, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who corporally <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> them many yeares after, did ſpiritually now <hi>follow</hi> them, that is in his ſacred Deity, or as he was God, not man, marched with them from the beginning to the end, and ſo by his providence ſtill ſupplyed them with <hi>water,</hi> which was in effect to make <hi>the rock follow them:</hi> ſo here <hi>Chriſt</hi> his divinity was the thing ſignified by <hi>the water out of the rock,</hi> which did repreſent the ſame; and to clear this ſence, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes in plaine termes, the <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

To conclude, the Allegory of this place holds thus. <hi>Chriſt was this rock,</hi> who was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayd <hi>ſtrucken</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> were of the Moſaicall Synagogue, who <hi>ſtruck Chriſt</hi> to death by the <hi>Rod</hi> of the holy Croſſe, the bloud of which <hi>rock</hi> was ſatiating <hi>drink</hi> to the true believers, and was <hi>water</hi> of <hi>contradiction</hi> to the Incredulous <hi>Iewes,</hi> who will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his deity, and misbelieving hereticks, that deny the reality of his bleſſed body and bloud in the Sacrament of the holy Altar, by whoſe virtue we are carried through <hi>the deſart</hi> of this world into the heavenly Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; nor will it follow, that therefore theſe words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaying, <hi>this is my body,</hi> are to be underſtood as hereticks pretend, <hi>This is a figure of my body,</hi> as here we ſay, this is a <hi>ſpiritual rock,</hi> that ſignifies <hi>This is a figure of a ſpiritual rock,</hi> becauſe Chriſt doth not ſay, this is a figure of my body, or this is my body <hi>ſpiritually</hi> meant, no, but this is my body, abſolutely and really, the ſame which ſhall be crucified for your ſinns upon the croſſe, as it was indeed, not onely figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, but really: beſides the ſixth verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cleares all doubt of this point, ſaying in expreſſe termes,

                           <head>The Explication.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. WHen it is ſaid the kingdome of heaven is like a <hi>man</hi> doing as this Parable relates, the meaning is, that in heaven it is done, as here by ſuch <hi>a man</hi> is ſaid to be done; though true it is, this alludes alſo to the great ones in this world: Let us therefore ſtate the Parable thus: By the <hi>Vineyard</hi> is meant the Church, by the <hi>market,</hi> the world, by thoſe called at the <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> and <hi>ſixth</hi> hour are underſtood the Jews, ſignfied in their forefathers <hi>Abraham, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> called to Gods ſervice in that ſort, as hee was pleaſed to lay his commands upon his Church or Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue rather; by <hi>the laſt called</hi> are ſignified the Gentiles in their <hi>primitiae</hi> or firſt fruits; the holy Apoſtles who were made the Pillars and Props of the Chriſtian Church: By the <hi>evening</hi> is meant the day of Judgement, when every one ſhall <hi>receive his hire</hi> according to his labours in the Church of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that is, the penny which was promiſed unto him for his pains, and <hi>this penny</hi> is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory to the bleſſed deſerving well, though withall by the word <hi>penny</hi> is underſtood pence of ſeverall coins, or rather values; that is to ſay, monie called a <hi>penny</hi> at pleaſure, though worth perhaps much more: Again, we are to note, the greater reward is not given for the the greater pains, but for the greater grace, or greater co-operation with equall grace, and according to this ſenſe by <hi>the firſt</hi> are underſtood the bleſſed or ſaved ſouls, by <hi>the laſt,</hi> the accurſed, or damned men and Angels; but divers of the Fathers explicate this Parable thus: As by <hi>the firſt made laſt,</hi> to underſtand thoſe who have been longeſt Catholikes, but making leſſe uſe of time and grace, than thoſe who are later called to the Catholike
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:204830:137"/> Faith, and yet make more profit of their little time, and more uſe perhaps of their leſſe grace, than others have done: So then the <hi>penny</hi> which is heaven, is equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to each, each being ſaved, and none damned, though the laſt called have the greater glory, which makes no eſſentiall difference in the Beatitude common to them all; that is, in their genericall or objective bliſs, which conſiſts in ſeeing God the Beatifying object, whom all ſhall ſee, though there ſhall be a difference in their more or leſſe cleerly ſeeing this bliſſefull Object, or Objective bliſſe, according to their more or leſſe Merit, or Co-operation with the Grace given unto them in this life, So though they have an equality of a moſt happy eternity, yet ſhall they not be equally happy by equality of glory in that eternity of happineſſe; and in this ſenſe the parts of the parable are thus to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. That by the <hi>day</hi> we underſtand the whole courſe of this world, by the ſeverall <hi>houres</hi> of this <hi>day</hi> we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the particular ages thereof; by the <hi>firſt hour,</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noe;</hi> by the next, from <hi>Noe</hi> to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> by the <hi>third</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes;</hi> by the <hi>ſixth</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> by the <hi>eleventh,</hi> or laſt, from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the day of <hi>doom:</hi> Thus S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and others. Or by the <hi>day</hi> may be meant the whole time of each mans life, by the ſeverall <hi>hours,</hi> his Infancie, youth, viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, old age, and decrepicie. Thus S. <hi>Hierome</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: But the fulleſt ſenſe, and that which beſt exhauſts the whole Parable, is to joyn all theſe together; ſo what falls ſhort in one, will come home, and be ſupplyed by the other: for though here S. <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> enumeration of parts in the Parable ſeem different from S. <hi>Hieromes,</hi> yet they both agree in the ſenſe, of the equall penny given to <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>la t,</hi> whereas the former enumeration of theſe parts, caſteth out the laſt from all reward, and ſuppoſeth them damned ſouls, ſo there are but two ſenſes in three Enumerations of parts to this Parable. And this long
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:204830:138"/> Preamble in the firſt Verſe will eaſe us much in the explication of all the reſt, and ſhorten what is to be ſaid upon them.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>covenant</hi> here made with the <hi>Workmen</hi> for a <hi>pennie,</hi> is the promiſe God makes of heaven to thoſe that live here in the Church of Chriſt, (which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his <hi>Vineyard</hi>) according to the Apoſtolicall Rule of Faith including good works, and co-operation with the grace of God, anſwerable to the proportion thereof gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The <hi>Romans</hi> firſt, and then the <hi>Jewes</hi> under them divided as well the day as the night into twelve parts by four equall diviſions, anſwerable to their four watches or changes of their Guards: The firſt hour of the day, when the firſt guard mounted, was from Sun-riſing: The third, was three hours after: The ſixth, ſix hours after that, which was noon-day: The ninth, was three hours after noon: The laſt, was at Sun-ſetting; and to theſe houres allude what is here ſaid of the ſeverall hours of mens being called to the vineyard of Chriſt: By thoſe who were found <hi>ſtanding idle</hi> are meant remiſs ſoules, who make it not their ſtudie or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to gain heaven, but expect it ſhould be given them <hi>gratis.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. Obſerve here in this Verſe and the next, there is no promiſe made of a <hi>penny,</hi> which was the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a whole dayes labour, but onely of what was <hi>juſt,</hi> proportionable to the time and merit of their pains, which argues for the doctrine of merit aſſerted, by the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> denyed by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who cannot endure to hear of merit in any but in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Nor is there any in men, as due, to what like men corrupted; they doe; though to what they doe as more than men, that is, as ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above the pitch or reach of nature, by grace wee doe allow them merit, but ſtill ſo as this merit receives value from Chriſt's Paſſion, not from Humane
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:204830:138"/> actions onely, and conſequently <hi>Chriſt</hi> merits in them, or they in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but not in themſelves or of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. This verſe puts us in mind that God hath more ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude to call us to him, than we have of going our ſelves.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Here we find an addition of a <hi>whole daies idleneſſe,</hi> whereas before there was onely ſome little loytering ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to thoſe that were called, as we heard <hi>ver.</hi> 3. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. The reaſon is, that this <hi>eleventh houre</hi> is the laſt which can be allowed to loſſe; for at the twelfth, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment begins, and therefore thoſe now called were told they had loſt all their former time, and were bid <hi>go,</hi> for one hour at leaſt, labour to ſave their ſoules: The former calls we may underſtand made to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> This latter to the <hi>Gentles. Origen</hi> takes <hi>Adam</hi> to ſignifie them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the firſt hour, <hi>Paul</hi> to ſignifie them called at the latter hour.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Hear the reaſon given by theſe laſt called, why they came no ſooner, becauſe <hi>no man</hi> did ſooner <hi>hire</hi> them, and to this excuſe the rationall maſter makes no reply, as not willing to blame where there was no fault, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely there is none in thoſe, who come not before God calls them, for it is impoſſible any corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould look towards heaven, were it not that Gods holy grace propends than that way. To theſe therefore it was onely ſaid, well, <hi>goe</hi> now at laſt, that I doe call you, imploy this laſt hour to Gods honour and glory; where obſerve, nothing is promiſed, not that theſe ſhall need feare to receive no reward, but that they ſhall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly acknowledge the little they can doe in ſo ſhort a time, as this life affords us, is not worthy ſo great a reward as heaven: and that thence Gods infinite goodneſſe may appear the more, giving to the leaſt minute of holy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, an everlaſting crown of glory for our rewards; a gallant incouragement indeed to all noble ſoules, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:204830:139"/> enough to give noble thoughts and hopes to the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſpirits.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. <hi>By evening</hi> is here meant the day of doome: by the <hi>Bayliffe, Origen</hi> underſtands <hi>S. Michael</hi> or the Angels guardian of each ſoule, ſummoning men to this latter Judgement, and leaving them to receive the publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or puniſhment, as formerly they had done the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: but better is Chriſt underſtood to be the <hi>Bayliffe</hi> here of his heavenly <hi>Father,</hi> paying each ſoule the hire of his labours; though ſome conceive the holy Ghoſt may be the rewarder, as he is by his grace given the Caller, and Imployer of Soules in the <hi>Vineyard</hi> or Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The reaſon why the <hi>penny</hi> is here called a <hi>reward,</hi> is becauſe a reward is not a thing given anſwerable to time or paines, but to merit, and therefore the diſtribution of this reward is ſaid to begin firſt with thoſe who were laſt called, becauſe the grace, whereby the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were made ſervants of <hi>God,</hi> and Labourers in <hi>Chriſts Vineyard,</hi> was infinitely more valuable than that whereby the <hi>Iewes</hi> were called; and conſequently no marvell if in an houres time it cauſed more merit in Chriſtians, than in all the ages before it had cauſed among the <hi>Iewes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="9">9. There was but a <hi>penny</hi> promiſed the firſt comers, and the <hi>laſt</hi> receiveing as much, were in that regard pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and made as it were the <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived equall reward for unequall labour, but ſince all reward was gratuite, as reſpecting the party rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, no marvell the rewarder gave his bounties as he pleaſed, though he would vouchſafe them the title of rewards.</p>
                           <p n="10">10, 11, 12. The greateſt difficulty we have here, is to explicate what is meant by <hi>murmur</hi> in that ſence of the parable; which makes <hi>the laſt</hi> to be ſaved ſoules: for thoſe, who underſtand them out-caſts from glory, will not ſcruple to ſay the damned ſoules live, not onely in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

                              <hi>murmur,</hi> but in open mutiny and rebellion againſt Almighty God for ſaving the Bleſſed, and not them too; but we may piouſly acquieſce here to <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez</hi> their interpretation of <hi>murmur,</hi> in the <hi>laſt</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee the <hi>firſt</hi> ſo ſtrangely above their merits rewarded, not that this admiring <hi>murmur</hi> is the leaſt repining, but the moſt extatick admiration of the infinite goodneſſe of Almighty God, firſt in ſaving any <hi>Iewes</hi> at all, ſince they had butchered his ſacred Sonne, next in giving an endeleſſe crown of Glory to an inſtantaneous time of labour, in the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This I ſay, we ſhall rather give to thoſe renowned men for a plauſible expoſition of this hard place, than contraſt with them the ſolidity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, unleſſe a better could be found out. By <hi>the burden of the day, and the beates,</hi> we may here underſtand the long time w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. the <hi>Iewes</hi> groaned under the dark law of <hi>Nature,</hi> or tormenting Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was the duration of the <hi>Iewiſh Synagogue,</hi> and the hot perſecution the <hi>Iewes</hi> groaned under not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the <hi>Romanes</hi> firſt ſack'd <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and deſtroyed it with the greateſt number of the Jewiſh nation, but while the ſubjection of the <hi>Iewes</hi> laſts, even to the worlds end, they being the ſcorne of men for ever in a juſt revenge of their ſcorning the moſt <hi>beautifull among the Sonnes of men,</hi> CHRIST JESUS.</p>
                           <p n="13">13, 14. Theſe two verſes ſhew, that firſt there was no injuſtice done to him, who had the juſt reward of his labours, which he contracted for: next, a contracted bragaine with one, hinders not an ultroneous reward to another, if a man pleaſe to beſtow his bounty upon thoſe, who never laboured to deſerve it, ſince it is free for any man to diſpoſe of his own, as beſt pleaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. This is a friendly expoſtulation of the Maſter with the Servants, who needed not have given other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for <hi>his will</hi> but his own pleaſure; and though here he

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:204830:142"/> Sunday we were taught our life was a mere <hi>labour</hi> here upon earth, and that we were all <hi>hired</hi> as <hi>labourers</hi> to work in the <hi>Vineyard</hi> of Chriſt, me thought it was not ſtrange, this next Goſpell ſhould bring us in <hi>labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> indeed, and like ſo many husband men <hi>ſowing with corne</hi> the Vineyard we had lately ploughed up; nor was it then ſo ſtrange to heare us call upon the <hi>chiefe labourer,</hi> (now in eternall reſt) <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> to help us with his interceſſion, that our <hi>labours</hi> might be, if not as great or as profitable, at leaſt as inceſſant as his were, who by the common ſuffrages of all the Church will eaſily be granted to have been the chiefe <hi>Seeds-man</hi> thereof, though <hi>Saint Peter</hi> were the chiefe paſtor or governour; and if ſo, then it will be a moſt proper prayer on that day, when the Goſpell runns all upon <hi>ſowing</hi> ſeed in ſeverall grounds (as to day it doth) that the principall <hi>Seeds-man</hi> be called upon to help us, the chiefe Preacher, he that is ſtiled the <hi>Doctor of Gentiles,</hi> or Nations, for his eminence in preaching, that is to ſay in <hi>ſowing</hi> the word of God in the hearts of men; and that <hi>this word is the ſeed to day made mention off,</hi> we have our Saviours own authority to avouch it; ſo we cannot be ſaid to have ſtrained this ſenſe out of the prayer to day, becauſe it is as genuine to it, as the <hi>Word of God</hi> in the parable, is <hi>to the ſeed</hi> our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth compare it unto; and look how many waies Expoſitors make Analogies between the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Seed,</hi> ſo many waies at leaſt ſhall we find this a proper prayer both to the Epiſtle and Goſpel of the day; and we may hope for the ſame anſwer from heaven, whileſt we complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like <hi>S.

Note (<hi>v.</hi> 7.) he profeſſeth to have preached <hi>gratis,</hi> without taking by way of taxe any thing from the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but ſupplying himſelf of means from <hi>Macedonia,</hi> rather than he would burthen them: This he alludes to, (<hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>if any take</hi>) as falſe <hi>Apostles</hi> did. Note (<hi>v.</hi> 16. of this Chapter) he deſires them to beare with the folly of his now pretended (nay intended) boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſhew how they were fooled by their falſe <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in that way, and tels them (<hi>v.</hi> 15.) he is not in his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours interiour to the greateſt of thoſe boaſting-<hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and ſome expoſitors underſtand that verſe of the reall <hi>Apostles,</hi> and of his non-inferiority

For we are to note, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had huge oppoſition againſt him by theſe Silver-tongued men, and perſons of quality; who partly by their power with Friends, partly by their tranſcendent Eloquence did much miſchief amongſt the Faithfull; ſo that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here was fain to uſe part of his enemies Arts, by vaunting himſelf, to try if that might keep the faithfull from being ſeduced by ſuch ſlights: and who can deny but a pious ſlight is more avouchable, than an impious one: ſo in this Verſe he partly jeers, partly flatters; as who ſhould ſay, <hi>You are wiſe</hi> in Chriſt, and yet let <hi>the fools,</hi> his enemies, carry you away from him.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. It was indeed notorious, the thraldome which theſe falſe Apoſtles brought their adhaerents into, by attendance on them, as little <hi>Gods,</hi> by exhauſting their eſtates in maintaining theſe mens prides, which he calls <hi>devouring them,</hi> and <hi>buffeting them on the face</hi> with contumelious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching them of their faults in the open hearing, of others.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. In this verſe the Apoſtle pretends he can, if it pleaſe him, act the tyrannicall part alſo, <hi>take</hi> from them as much as others doe, <hi>extoll</hi> himſelf as high as others doe, and depreſſe them as much as any dares to doe it,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:204830:145"/> and this kinde of ſpeech he profeſſeth to be ignoble, <hi>diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi> nay, <hi>fooliſh;</hi> yet ſome others prevail by ſuch means, therefore he gives himſelf leave to act that part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while.</p>

In this Verſe he vaunts to be of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Race, as well as others who boaſted of it; where we are to note, the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> by paſſing the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> were called even thence <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>paſſe-over,</hi> as the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> did paſſe <hi>Euphrates</hi> to live in <hi>Paleſtina.</hi> And <hi>Abraham,</hi> as we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. was the firſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an <hi>Hebrean,</hi> becauſe he was the firſt that paſſed <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> or as others think, becauſe they were deſcended of them, that in the confuſion of <hi>Babylon,</hi> onely reſerved the pure Hebrew tongue, the Faith and Religion of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to which deſcent, as the falſe Apoſtles laid claime, ſo doth Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> and thus conſequently an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and of <hi>Abrahams Seed,</hi> as well as they, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. <hi>I am a Jew, born in</hi> Tarſus <hi>the Metropolitan of Sicilie.</hi>

He doth not here affirm, <hi>They are the Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> but takes it as an aſſertion of their own; and for argument ſake lets it paſs, ſaying, he is truly ſo, whereas they onely pretend it; and for even letting this paſs for a truth, he tells them, he ſpeaks as <hi>one ſcarſe wiſe,</hi> for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring them in ſuch fond arguments; yet they are <hi>ad hominem,</hi> ſuch as themſelves uſing, they cannot but allow them to have force, if he uſe them too; and whereas the falſe <hi>Prophets</hi> boaſted of the pains they took, the true <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here profeſſeth he hath taken much more pains than they, to indear himſelf to them, ſince he was <hi>often in Priſon,</hi> for <hi>labouring</hi> to convert Souls, and was often <hi>beaten</hi> on the High way; by <hi>deaths</hi> are here meant the dangers of death, to which he often expoſed himſelf.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. It was a Law in <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. ver. 5. that no man corrected with ſtripes ſhould receive above fourty laſhes, and ſo to be ſure not to infringe this Law, the Jewes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave above <hi>thirty nine ſtroaks</hi> to any Malefactor that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:204830:145"/> they whipped; and therefore when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was five times whipt for his preaching, he had every time one ſtroak leſs than <hi>fourty;</hi> which whipping he avoided at <hi>Rome,</hi> by pretending the priviledge of <hi>Tarſus,</hi> whoſe natives were all held <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſo free from that baſe puniſhment of being whipt.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. He tells here of much more than Saint <hi>Luke</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Saint <hi>Luke</hi> writes not all the truth, though all he writ be undoubtedly true. It ſeemes this <hi>whipping with rodds</hi> was different from the former flagellations he ſpake of, which was with <hi>whips.</hi> He ſayes <hi>the wracks he ſuffered</hi> were in the <hi>middle Ocean,</hi> not as uſually on the ſhoars; ſo that it was miraculous how he eſcaped, and therefore he ſpeaks, as if he had been ſo often at the <hi>depth of the Sea,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe had not Miracles preſerved him, and brought him like <hi>Ionas</hi> to the ſhoar, he had indeed been drowned; ſo he tells what naturally would have been his fate, but that God providentially prevented it.</p>
                           <p n="26">26, 27. See here how both by <hi>Iewes</hi> (thoſe of his own Religion and Race, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.) he was in danger, in all times, in all places, by all parties of acquaintance; friends as well as foes, whom he calls <hi>Falſe Brethren,</hi> pretending friendſhip, and yet betraying him; which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings ought to be incouragements to <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours</hi> ever after, finding how their Predeceſſour led them the way, and pattern of Apoſtolicall behaviour in ſuch occaſions.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. He paſſeth now from his <hi>outward</hi> troubles to his inward <hi>cares of all the Churches under him,</hi> all the Souls converted by him; and any one of theſe Souls he values at ſo high a rate, that to ſave her, he is willing often to incur all theſe enumerated dangers.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. What greater tenderneſs can be expreſſed, than the making other mens evills his own, out of the equall love he bears to them with himſelf; hence he is <hi>weak</hi> with

                           <p n="30">30. Now whereas the Falſe Apoſtles did <hi>glory</hi> in their power amongſt the people, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (to teach the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> better principles, makes profeſſion to <hi>glory</hi> rather <hi>in his infirmities;</hi> that is, in thoſe paſſages of his life, which rendred him mean, and contemptible in the ſight of others, in his being <hi>whipt,</hi> and ſcorned for Chriſt his ſake; not in his Miracles, for there he ſhewed power, but in his ſufferings; not in his Sins, for had he committed any, thoſe he could not boaſt of, nay, muſt bluſh at, but in his being <hi>weak</hi> with the <hi>weak, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:204830:147"/> where God ſhews himſelf in his greateſt glory, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, this is called <hi>the third,</hi> not as to averr there are but three heavens in all, but as to include all, be there never ſo many, by the briefeſt way, which is by ſaying, three for all: Yet the common diviſion of the heavens into <hi>Aereall,</hi> Aethereall, and Empyreall will ſerve literally to this Text, making the ayre the firſt heaven, ſo birds are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Inhabitants of Heaven; The ſecond, the Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall, which includes all the voluble Orbs above us, and the Empyreall to be that of the Bleſſed; to which laſt underſtand the <hi>rapture</hi> of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to have been. The greateſt doubt is, whether he were rapt both <hi>bodie</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> up ſo high, ſome think no, and that this rapture may bee underſtood to be imaginary onely, or Intellectuall, wherein he had a revelation or viſion of ſtranger things, than <hi>were lawfull</hi> for him to ſpeak, or then were in his power to utter, if it had been <hi>lawfull,</hi> and this they ground out of the 1. verſe of this Chapter, and out of the 17. both which mention <hi>viſions;</hi> yet it is much more probable, that he was really rapt both <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>bodie:</hi> Firſt, becauſe it was as eaſie for God to doe both as one; Secondly, becauſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doubts whether it were ſo or not, as we ſee in this ſecond and third Verſe, where he profeſſeth <hi>not to know,</hi> which in his ſenſe is to doubt; whereas thoſe who have <hi>viſions or revelations</hi> doe not doubt, but know they are upon earth, for all thoſe Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which onely make a rapture of the ſoul, but none of the bodie: ſo it is probable, as <hi>Moſes</hi> went corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally up to the mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where he was <hi>rapt</hi> out of the ſight of the people by interpoſition of a cloud ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from their eyes, and had delivered into his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ears the words of the Law, in like manner Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was to be the heavenly <hi>Doctor</hi> of all nations, had corporally delivered to him ſuch <hi>ſecret words,</hi> as he mentions even in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> to have received; and thence to bring back to earth ſuch a <hi>Magazine</hi> of ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,

But we muſt here ſolve a difficulty before we proceed further, and that is to give the reaſon why our Saviour, who did nothing in vain, ſhould upon deſigne, looſe his labour; that is to ſay, Preach to a people who did not underſtand one word of his Sermon; nay, why he ſhould ſo couch his ſpeeches, as to make them not intelligible by the people: as if he were reſolved to take away the little underſtanding they had before, by
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:204830:152"/> this preſent parabolicall expreſſion of his minde unto them; and indeed Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> in relating this Story, tells us as much in plain termes, ſaying, our Saviour anſwered his Diſciples to this queſtion in theſe termes, chap. 13. ver. 12. <hi>He that hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall abound; but he that hath not, even that whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:204830:152"/> purpoſely to prevent their deſignes of ſcoffing at what I ſay, becauſe I will not ſpeak to be underſtood by them: yet withall, in regard there are ſome few amongſt them, who have a little zeal, therefore I ſpeak in <hi>parables,</hi> at leaſt to them, that hearing me ſpeak, they may come after me, or you, to know the meaning of what I ſaid, and ſo to increaſe in them their zeals, by little and little opening their eyes and underſtandings: and this may, I hope, ſuffice for a ſufficient expoſition of the two Verſes. Now to the Parable and Explication thereof, as our Saviour himſelf delivered it to his Diſciples, that thereby the Faith they had in him before, might be increaſed, when they ſee how much ſolidity of clear Doctrine, and true Piety, was couched under his parabolicall expreſſions.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. 11, 12. As to the fifth, or eleventh and tweltfth verſes (for theſe are in ſenſe all one, as our Saviour himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in the very letter of the Texts) we are therefore one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give a reaſon, why <hi>the Word of God</hi> is compared to <hi>ſeed of Corn ſowed in the fields:</hi> and we ſhall finde as many reaſons for it, as there are Analogies between <hi>the Seed,</hi> and <hi>the Word,</hi> the <hi>Sowing</hi> the one, and Preaching the other: as firſt, becauſe the <hi>Word</hi> of the Preacher is caſt into the ears of his Auditory out of the Pulpit, as the <hi>Seed</hi> is caſt over all the ground by the <hi>ſowing</hi> Seeds-man: Secondly, as <hi>the Word</hi> links from the Ear of the hearer into the Heart, ſo the <hi>Seed</hi> deſcends by degrees from the ſurface, or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the earth, into the bowels thereof: Thirdly, as <hi>Seed</hi> is the Mother of all Fruits, ſo <hi>the Word of God</hi> is the Parent of all good Works: Fourthly, as the Earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Seed</hi> brings forth nothing but weeds, bryars, and brambles; ſo Man, without the <hi>Word of God,</hi> brings forth nothing but futility, vice, and vanity: Fifthly, as <hi>Seed</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſoft, manured, and tilled ground to grow in, ſo the <hi>Word</hi> of God muſt finde gentle, rich, and mortified Souls to fructifie upon: Sixthly, as <hi>Seed</hi> requires moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and ſun to bring it forth; ſo the Soul requires the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:204830:153"/> tears of ſorrow for our Sins, and the Son of Juſtice, his heat of Grace to make the <hi>Word of God</hi> fructifie in mans heart, and bring forth Acts of love to God. Seventhly, as the <hi>Seed</hi> in the Earth muſt firſt diſſolve, and die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſpring, ſo muſt <hi>the Word of God</hi> be ruminated upon by meditation, and procure in us a death to the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can find in our ſelves the ſpring of living in Gods favour Eighthly, as the <hi>Seed</hi> muſt firſt take root, then ſprout up, branch into leaves and boughs, next bloſſome, and then knit into a fruit; ſo the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> muſt firſt enter deep into our hearts, then riſe by holy cogitations, branch it ſelf into variety of good deſires, bloſſom into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious reſolutions, &amp; at laſt knit it ſelf up into the knot of good Works, which are the fruits of our lives: Ninethly, as the force and vertue of all fruits is contracted into its <hi>Seed,</hi> ſo the force of all our good Works is lodged in the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Tenthly, as diverſe <hi>ſeeds</hi> bring diverſe fruits, ſo diverſe ſentences of Scripture bring forth diverſe Vertues in our Souls: Eleventhly, as to the child of fruit are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired two parents, the <hi>Seed</hi> as the male, and the Earth as the female; ſo to the Children of Vertues are required the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and his holy Grace: Laſtly, as from the beſt <hi>Seed</hi> (man preparing his ground with moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry) proceeds the beſt Crop of Corn: ſo from the beſt choſen Texts delivered by the beſt Preachers, (thoſe that uſe the moſt diligence in preparing, and making ſoft the hearts of their penitents towards God) proceed the beſt fruits of Vertue and good Works here, as unto the beſt Saints, to ſerve as fruits for a Heavenly banquet in the next World. Now we ſee the meaning <hi>of the ſeed,</hi> let us examine the reaſons why theſe ſeverall effects follow upon the ſeverall <hi>grounds</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> falleth on. Firſt, that falling <hi>on the high-way</hi> cannot enter to take root for growth, and conſequently lying open, to be both trodden to pieces by paſſengers, and pecked up by birds, muſt needs be like to ſo much caſt away: ſuch is <hi>the Word of God,</hi> as Saint

                              <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayes, <hi>Heard,</hi> but not underſtood, becauſe the <hi>hearer</hi> doth not ask his ſpirituall Adviſer the meaning of what is told him, but pretends to be ſatisfied therein, when indeed he carries away the onely empty ſound of words, but is wholly ignorant of the ſenſe through his own lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in not asking the meaning thereof; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently what is thus ignorantly received, is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; and by that means makes no entrance into the heart of the hearer, ſo is trodden to pieces even by our own trampling over it, whilſt we run from Sermons, as if we had never heard a word of what the Preacher ſaid unto us; which indeed is commonly their caſe that come to Church for curioſity, to hear Humane Eloquence, not Divine Preaching; to ſee, and to be ſeen, not to hear their faults, and amend them; to laugh indeed at the Preacher, if he pleaſe not the pallate of their fancy, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ears, as thoſe did, to whom (for that very reaſon) Chriſt ſpake Parables, not clear ſenſe; and to ſuch as theſe, be the Preachers words never ſo clear, never ſo eaſie, they ſound as Parables in his ears, whoſe own diſtracted minde robs him of the faculty of underſtanding what he hears; and though ſuch men ſeeme to come to God, when they appear in Churches, yet in very truth their coming is to the Devill in Gods Houſe: and no marvell then he carry them, and their underſtandings away with him, leſt <hi>hearing</hi> (that is intelligently hearing) <hi>they believe,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving plow up <hi>the high-way,</hi> their hearts with acts of Love, and ſo render the <hi>Corn</hi> (the Word of God) capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſink into their Souls, and take root to their emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, indeed to their Salvation, as Text the ſpeaketh.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. 13. The firſt reaſon of the <hi>Corn</hi> failing to grow, was the want of ſinking into the earth, now it fails, (though ſunk) becauſe it wants <hi>moiſture</hi> by incountring a ſtony, or rocky <hi>ground,</hi> which is onely covered with a ſhallow ſuperficies of earth, and cannot receive <hi>moiſture</hi> enough to carry the <hi>Corn</hi> deeper into the ground, and to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:204830:154"/> root it there. This place alludes to ſchiſmaticks, whoſe petrifying hearts, whoſe cold affections to God turn all they hear of him (how ever they believe it to be true) into rocks and ſtones, into ſterility, and barrenneſs of Soul; and hence rather, than ſuffer the leaſt temporall loſſe for Gods ſake, they hazard to looſe themſelves eternally. A clear place to covince Hereticks by, that Faith alone is not ſufficient without good Works to ſave them, and that Souls, though once in the Grace of God, may neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs looſe his favour, and the Kingdome of Heaven too.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. 14. The ſecond reaſon of failing, was for want of ground to take ſufficient root, and to cheriſh the <hi>Seed,</hi> in both which may ſeeme to be defects of intrinſecall requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites; now this third reaſon points at what is extrinſecally neceſſary, and rather at defects of redundance, than of want, becauſe the <hi>Corn</hi> wants no inward cauſe of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but is outwardly hindred, by being <hi>choaked,</hi> or kept down with over growing bryars, and <hi>thorns,</hi> that hinder the riſing thereof: Now, though our Saviour beſt knew how to explicate his own meaning, and hath declared, that by theſe <hi>Thornes</hi> he means <hi>Riches,</hi> which prick the Soules of thoſe that poſſeſſe them in their riſing up to acts of love towards God, and ſo force them down again to the love of earthly things: yet Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> found this expoſition ſo beyond his expectation of this Text, that he admiring, ſayes, <hi>If he had thus expounded it, the world would not have believed him to attinge the true ſenſe thereof;</hi> as being poſſeſſed, what they handle and hugge dayly ſn their armes, (their wealth and <hi>riches</hi>) cannot prick, nor gall them, yet now our Saviour ſayes they doe ſo, we muſt believe it: and truly ſo it is, for what more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, than to ſee the high and mighty men of the world (mighty, I mean, in wealth) abject, and lowe in their growth upwards to Heaven, to ſee them ſtill pricking down their riſing Souls; and under the title of <hi>riches,</hi> we may here underſtand honours, pleaſures, paſtimes of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:204830:154"/> the vain, licentious, and idle people of the world, whoſe own conſcience tells them they doe ill in following ſuch courſes as yet they will not leave.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. 15. By the <hi>good ground</hi> is here underſtood a tender Conſcience, which makes a Religion of each action; and ſo <hi>hearing Gods Word,</hi> firſt labours to underſtand it, then puts in execution the Doctrine thereof, and thereby <hi>brings forth fruits</hi> of all ſorts of Vertue, and good Works; nay, brings forth indeed an <hi>hundred fold,</hi> or more, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proportion and meaſure of grace received from Almighty God; but we are here to obſerve the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplicative ſpeech of <hi>a good, and a very good heart;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>a heart</hi> illuminated with Faith, but working by Charity; or as <hi>Albertus</hi> will have it, <hi>Good, by being free from Sin; very good, by being in all things confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabled to the Will of God:</hi> or as Saint <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſayes, <hi>Good, by verity, or rectitude in the underſtanding; very good, by rectitude in the affections;</hi> or as Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> will have it; <hi>Good, by loving our neighbour as our ſelves; very good,</hi> by loving God above all things; ſaying, and <hi>they properly retaine the Word,</hi> (as the Bleſſed Virgin did) and <hi>bring forth the fruit thereof in patience,</hi> that is, by bearing with unperturbed minds, the perturbations of this world. And though S. <hi>Luke</hi> do not mention the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of fruits produced, yet S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 13 ver 23. ſpeaks of the <hi>Thirty fold, the ſixty fold,</hi> and <hi>the hundred fold</hi> fruit of thoſe who <hi>hear the Word of God</hi> as they ought to doe; meaning, it makes ſome good men, others bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, others beſt of all, according to the reſpective meaſures of diſpoſitions in their Souls, anſwerable to their ſeverall proportions of Grace, and co-operations therewith, or if we will have theſe three-fold quantities all in one Soul, then ſay, we bring forth <hi>Thirty,</hi> when we think well; <hi>Sixty</hi> when we ſpeak well; <hi>an hundred fold,</hi> when we do well: or when we begin to be vertuous, profit therein, and at laſt attain to the perfection of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

                           <p>NO marvell, if many of my friends told me here the common place of this Prayer would not eaſily be made particularly proper to our deſign of a ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between that prayer and the other parts of this days ſervice; for ſee in the Epiſtle <hi>charity,</hi> in the Goſpel <hi>faith</hi> inſiſted on, whereas in the Prayer neither of theſe vertues are mentioned. What remedy? truly none but by applying myſtically to our ſelves that now which was actually done when our Saviour lived; and by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, that as the propagation of <hi>faith,</hi> amongſt Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels was the chief work of Chriſt, ſo the conſervation and augmentation of <hi>charity,</hi> is the chief thing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have to doe; for as <hi>Faith</hi> was the <hi>Baſis</hi> or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church whileſt it was a building, ſo <hi>charity</hi> muſt bee the covering and top thereof now it is built: What wonder then, while the Goſpel tells us, how Chriſt confirmed in his Diſciples by the miracle upon the blinde <hi>the faith</hi> of his Deity: That the Epiſtle exhorts us (who need not, God be praiſed, any confirmation of our <hi>faith</hi>) to an augmentation of our <hi>charity</hi> by ſeeing it laid to day before us in ſuch lively colours, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath drawn it in; ſo that whileſt holy Church tells us, what <hi>Chriſt</hi> then did towrds the Jews, by introducing <hi>faith</hi> among them with miracles, we that now need no miracles, ſhould doe towards him, by acts of <hi>love</hi> to the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: that is to ſay, labour to ſhew our loves to him as he did to beget faith in them; but what will this avail to our deſign? though we admit the Epiſtle may fitly talk of <hi>charity</hi> while the Goſpel runs all upon <hi>faith,</hi> ſince the prayer which wee muſt have to ſuit with both theſe vertues, makes not the leaſt mention of either? Truly we muſt look back to ſome rules given us in the Preface to

                           <p n="31">31. OUr Saviour being now neer the time, wherein he was pleaſed to be ſacrificed for mans redemption, took with him in this his laſt aſcending to the grand feaſt of the Jewes, their Paſchall ſolemnity, all his twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and leſt they ſhould be ſurpriſed by his ſudden death, which they knew not to be at hand, (as himſelf did) he forewarnes them of it, nay, for their further comfort he tells them, his death was fore-told long before by the holy <hi>Prophets;</hi> but with this conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory clauſe of his riſing again, after he was dead, to prove thereby it was God redeemed us, when God and Man dyed for us, and ſuch was the Meſſias; ſuch was he, who now foretold them this of himſelf, to prepare their patience againſt his paſſion, to ſecure their Faith, though he loſt his own life for that purpoſe: And that this was the laſt time of our Saviours going to this City of Hieruſalem, in obſervation of their Paſchall ſolemnity, all the four Evangeliſts agree; Saint <hi>John</hi> onely adding this circumſtance, Chap. 11. ver. 54. that Jeſus came now <hi>from the City Ephrem</hi> privately to this Feaſt, having fled thither for fear of the Jewes, after he had raiſed <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> from death to life a little before, and was much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, and ſought after, to puniſh, not to reward him, for his ſaid goodneſs: Now ſome Expoſitours will have it, that from this very inſtant of Chriſt foretelling his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles he ſhould die, and riſe again, <hi>Judas</hi> gave his firſt way to the temptation of covetouſneſs, which moved him to betray his Maſter for Mony, ſince he did believe the firſt part of his death, but gave no credit to his laſt, of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing again; and ſo concluded, when once his Maſter was dead, all the little treaſure of the common purſe would fall to his ſhare, that feared no account to be exacted
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:204830:166"/> from a dead man by his Reſurrection; nor is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture improbable: But to the letter of the Text, we ſhall not doe amiſſe to obſerve the phraſe our Saviour uſeth, ſaying here, <hi>Behold, we goe up;</hi> and indeed, the word <hi>Aſcend, or goe up,</hi> alludes deeply to the myſtery of the prediction, as above, of Chriſt his paſſion; for by <hi>aſcending</hi> voluntarily now to this Feaſt, he ſhewed he was as voluntarily to <hi>aſcend</hi> within few dayes out of this City up the Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> to his Paſſion. Again, the Temple of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was upon the higheſt part of the Town, and contiguous, if not continuous to the Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which over-looked the City, and ſo by Analogie, the heavenly <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> is called <hi>Sion;</hi> beſides, he now ſaid, <hi>we aſcend,</hi> as ſhewing with what alacrity he reſolved to riſe up the aſcending Mount, when he was upon the Croſs to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over Sin, Death, the Devill, and Hell: for as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes well, <hi>By his voluntary death he ſhewed himſelf to be God, as well as Man, ſince though to be able to die, argued he was man, yet to be willing to die, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he was more than man.</hi> But ſee how he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to tell them in generall termes of his future Death and Paſſion, and that it ſhould <hi>be conſummated, as was written by the Prophets,</hi> unleſſe he had farther told them, what particular death he was to die, ſaying as followes.</p>
                           <p n="32">32. <hi>For he ſhall be delivered to the Gentiles,</hi> as he was, when <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> (ſubſtitutes of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) ſet upon him as Judges; and condemned him, after many <hi>mockeries, ſcourgings,</hi> and revilings, even to the Death of the Croſſe: but becauſe the proper place to enlarge upon this ſubject will be, when the Paſſion is dilated upon, here we ſhall ſay no more of it, than that</p>
                           <p n="33">33. He foretells the Glory of his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> ſhall recompence the ignominy of his death: and this hony of his riſing, he gave them a taſte off, thereby to ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the gall of his Paſſion; nor ſhall we now adde more, here, than that as Chriſt uſed the prediction of his
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:204830:166"/> Death, as a meanes of comfort to his Apoſtles, in hope of his future Reſurrection, ſo we muſt make affliction, ſorrow, grief, perſecution, and death it ſelf for love of God, ſweet unto us, in hope we ſhall <hi>riſe</hi> from death to glory, and from our corruption to incorruptibility, as our Saviour did.</p>
                           <p n="34">34. No marvell they <hi>underſtood not theſe words,</hi> nor the <hi>things</hi> they meant, for our Saviour did not then intend they ſhould underſtand them, but then only told them what they ſhould hereafter know by experience; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring they had been foretold as much, ſhould not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, but hope they ſhould, by the integrity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, (including the joy of his Reſurrection) be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of their affliction at his Death and Paſſion.

                           <p n="35">35. There is ſome difficulty in the true meaning of this verſe, in regard Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 20. ver. 19. and Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> in his tenth chap. ver. 46. both of them ſay this blinde man was cured by our Saviour, as he went out of <hi>Jericho;</hi> whereas Saint <hi>Luke</hi> here tells us, it was done as Jeſus went into <hi>Jericho;</hi> again, Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> make mention onely of one blinde man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his ſight; and yet Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame time and place, tells us of two blind, then and there cured by Jeſus, as he paſſed by them, and heard them both in the ſame words, as (the other two Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts ſay one onely) they called on him for cure, ſaying, <hi>Ieſus, ſon of</hi> David, <hi>have mercy on me, on us,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Matthew;</hi> but for reconciliation of theſe two different relations by the Evangeliſts, we muſt recurre to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed obſervation that Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> generally under
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:204830:167"/> takes to write the Story of our Saviours life moſt metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically; and therefore ſince he, from the verſe 29. above cited, to the verſe 33. ending his ſaid twentieth Chapter, continues his Story in the plurall number, we are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume there were two blind men cured, though here S. <hi>Luke</hi> mentions but one, and though Saint <hi>Mark</hi> name that one to be <hi>Bartimaeus,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Timaeus</hi> ſo called; as <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomaeus</hi> is called the ſon of <hi>Tholomaeus, Bar</hi> in Hebrew, importing <hi>Son:</hi> hence therefore we are to conclude there is no contradiction in the relation, though it be more amply, and intirely made by Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> than by the other Evangeliſts: and as for the differing circumſtances of the Miracle being done, as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> here ſaith, when our Saviour went into <hi>Iericho,</hi> happily one of the Two was then cured, and the other (namely <hi>Bartimaeus</hi>) when our Saviour came out: again, Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and Saint <hi>Mark</hi> may relate the Story as perfected by a double cure in the <hi>exit</hi> of our Saviour from <hi>Iericho,</hi> which S. <hi>Luke</hi> began with a ſingle one, in his entrance thither, as if it were a continuation of one and the ſame cure exerciſed upon two ſeverall perſons, one at the entrance, the other at the <hi>exit</hi> of the City; and ſo the circumſtantialls of the cure make n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:204830:167"/> mentioned as above, in the firſt verſe of this Goſpell; and though there we gave other reaſons, why our Saviour ſaid <hi>we aſcend to Hieruſalem;</hi> yet here we may adde this one more, that although while he went <hi>out of Ephrem,</hi> his wayes from thence <hi>to Iericho</hi> (being two leagues, and an half) were all levell and even ground, yet from <hi>Iericho to Ieruſalem</hi> there were ſeven long leagues, all hils and dales as mountainous wayes uſe to be, and therefore are called <hi>aſcendings,</hi> becauſe they take their denomination from their moſt difficult paſſages; however, there be much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending ground gone over between all hills: as for the name of <hi>Iericho,</hi> it is derived either from the Hebrew word <hi>Jareach,</hi> ſignifying the <hi>Moon,</hi> becauſe that City was built horned, as the quartered Moon; or elſe from <hi>reach,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>odour,</hi> or ſweetneſs, becauſe <hi>Iericho</hi> is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the beſt of Balſames, in, and about it: and Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> in his twelfth Homily upon the Goſpells, alludes to the cure done at <hi>Iericho</hi> upon the Blinde, taking this name in the firſt derivation from the Hebrew, and ſaying, The Moon is an Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Our Saviour asked <hi>what he would have,</hi> not that he was ignorant, but that he would declare, his knowledge of our infirmities excuſeeh us not from the confeſſing of them nevertheleſs: as alſo to ſhew God is not onely ready to give us what we lack, but alſo whatſoever we can rationally ask of him, who is no niggard of his favours, and while the blind man <hi>askes his ſight,</hi> we may conceive he askes as much as his life too, for a blind man is like a viſible death to all other men, and a ſenſible one unto himſelf: ſince he can feele miſery on all ſides, but ſee comfort no way: to which purpoſe ſee <hi>Tobias, Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. and heare <hi>Saint Ambroſe, Uti triſtes ſunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As the day without Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine is but ſad, and the nights without Moone-light not ſo pleaſing; ſo is the life of man deprived of the light of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his eyes: for they, (the Sunne and Moone) are as it were the eyes of the world, and without their luſtre the heavens themſelevs do ſuffer a deformity of blindneſſe:</hi> And S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> upon this place ſaies, <hi>Tota igitur vita,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Our whole lifes exerciſe therefore is but to cure this eye of the heart: to this end hath Almighty God inſtituted all the holy Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to this end is the word of God preached, to this end tend all Eccleſiaſtical exhortations,</hi> &amp;c. Let us therefore all cry out, O Lord, give us the light of Grace, to ſee the turpitude of ſinne, the vilitie of concupiſcence, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilitie of pleaſure, the atrocity of hell fire, the beauty of virtue, the happineſſe of Paradiſe, the eternity of Glory: Amen.</p>

We cannot read this ſtory, without being moved to imitate the gratitude of the blind man, in giving thankes for the benefit received, as we ſhall be forward enough to imitate his importunity in calling to God for help, in our neceſſities: and what was his gratitude? his <hi>following our Saviour: magnifying and prayſing of him,</hi> as alſo did all the people that were witneſſe to the benefit received; that we would our ſelves thus teſtifie our own gratitudes, thus get all the world to help us expreſſe our thanks for ſuch benefits as they all ſee, we receive daily and hourly from almighty God; ſince we have an aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, if we goe as farre with him, as this blind man did, to his paſſion, to his Croſs, to his death, to his grave, he will raiſe us with him to a new life of grace here, and to an eternall life of Glory in the next world.</p>

It was indeed his Charity that made him leave all other company to follow Jeſus, and to magnifie his Deity by proclaiming his mercy in having delivered him from miſery. And whither did he follow him? To <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to his Paſſion, to his Death, to his Sepulcher.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. O lively Faith that did not die in this poor man, when Jeſus dying for him, left even his Apoſtles tottering in their Faith. O burning Charity, that like a flaming lamp hung ore the Sepulcher of Jeſus dead and buried; Adoring then and magnifying the Divinity which never did forſake the ſacred corps of Chriſts Humanity, though his living ſoul had left his dead body in the grave. O ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable way to ſhake off the <hi>ſhackles</hi> of ſinne, and to keep us free from all <hi>adverſitie,</hi> thus firmely to believe, thus ardently to love, and ſo to follow Jeſus from his grave into his glory.

                           <p>IF in the holy time of Lent we find not ſo exact a report between the Epiſtle, Goſpell, and Prayer of the day, as at other times of the yeer, it muſt be given to the more
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:204830:182"/> then ordinary regard had unto the Lenten Faſt, which we ſhall obſerve all theſe Prayers make ſpeciall mention of, as if holy Church intended nothing more then a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends of that wholeſome Faſt unto us; nevertheleſſe I ſhall not deſpaire to find the Epiſtle and Goſpell, even like full-ſail'd Veſſels falling down this channell of holy abſtinence, and directed by the helme of the Prayer, come full fraughted with the ſame concording Spirits into the Ports of our ever open hearts to Ghoſtly comforts, which the other ſeaſons of the yeare afford unto us: But before we venture upon a thing ſo hard, let us facilitate the way, by firſt cleering the full ſenſe of the Prayer: for when we know what we aske therein, we ſhall ſee what relation the Petition hath to the Epiſtle and Goſpell, whence we muſt draw it out. Obſerve then firſt in this Prayer an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, that Almighty God doth <hi>purifie his Church with an annuall obſervation of Lent;</hi> ſo the end of this Faſt is the Churches purification. Next, ſee how the Prayer begs, that <hi>what we endeavour to obtaine by Faſting, we may finiſh by good workes;</hi> ſo though purification be the end of our Faſt, yet the Faſt alone is but an <hi>endeavour</hi> towards that end; and nothing brings us home unto it, unleſſe to the <hi>endeavouring faſt</hi> we adde the <hi>finiſhing help of good works:</hi> and this with great reaſon too; for as we are never ſaid to be perfectly purified, untill we can in a chaſte body repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a pure Soule to God; ſo by <hi>Faſting</hi> alone we onely chaſtize our bodies, but by <hi>good workes</hi> the grand affaire is <hi>finiſhed,</hi> our Soule is made pure, and then the Churches end is accompliſht, then the whole creatures we are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, (as was intended) <hi>purified:</hi> but leaſt I ſhould be thought to ſtate this ſenſe to my own deſigne, let us heare Saint <hi>Leo</hi> in his Homily upon this day (which the Prieſt reads in his Office) tell us his opinion, wherein conſiſts the perfection of our Lenten <hi>Faſts.</hi> 
                              <q>Not in the ſole ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from meat, conſiſteth the integrity of our Faſt, but in the joynt taking away our affections from ſinne thus hee;</q> and how ſhall we give better Teſtimony of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204830:182"/> our not being ſinners, then in doing <hi>good works,</hi> ſuch as may make us Saints: ſee here then the Scope of holy Faſt is as it were to ſtarve the body, and to feed the Soul; for in vaine <hi>this</hi> forbears to eat fleſh, if <hi>that</hi> doe not feaſt upon Spirituall Cates, ſuch as are <hi>good works,</hi> of Prayer, Almes-deeds and other ſorts of vertues, eſpecially recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in this holy time of Lent; nor is it without my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery the Prayer to day begges, we may <hi>finiſh by good workes, what we indeavour only by Faſting, our annuall puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications by this Lenten Abſtinence,</hi> ſince though we have the grace to keep the faſt exactly in point of dyet, yet <hi>in vaine</hi> our bodies faſt towards <hi>purification</hi> of the whole creature which we are, unleſſe our Soules at the ſame time feaſt upon vertues by abandoning all vices: &amp; in this the Prayer to day obſerves the method of the Epiſtle; <hi>in vaine</hi> the Miniſters of holy Church <hi>receive the grace of God,</hi> unleſſe they make uſe of <hi>the acceptable time, the dayes of ſalvation that now are flowing;</hi> and this by rendring themſelves (with <hi>good workes</hi>) pleaſing to all men, <hi>offenſive to none;</hi> unleſſe to their <hi>Faſt</hi> they adde the <hi>good works</hi> expreſſed in the Antiphon above, taken out of the ſame Epiſtle, and many more, which thoſe few referre unto, from one end of the Epiſtle to another: nor can we ſay theſe are counſels proper for Church-men only, ſince thoſe the expoſitours underſtand by <hi>Helpers in the Miniſtery of God;</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle layes himſelfe open to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> not only as <hi>a Miniſter of God</hi> requiring ſuch perfections, as this Epiſtle mentions, but as a patterne to the people to imitate; ſo that all the <hi>good workes</hi> he tells them, Churchmen ſhould be perfect in, he exhorts lay-men to practiſe too, as if he would have the ſheep equal Saints with their ſhepheards; and indeed this is no ſtrained ſenſe of mine; for we ſee holy Church to day exhibits unto us not only Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perfection in the Epiſtle, but even that of Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe, the Maſter of the Apoſtles, when his forty-dayes Faſt is ſet before our eyes in the Goſpell, and not that <hi>Faſt</hi> alone, but withall the addition of his <hi>good workes,</hi> his

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204830:184"/> of the Sacraments are <hi>helpers of Chriſt</hi> in the reconciliation of Chriſtians to Almighty God his favour, through the grace of the holy Sacraments diſpenſed to them by the hands of the Prieſts, who onely have this prerogative of reconciliation between God and Man, what by their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, what by their exhortations and Sacraments which are diſpenſed unto us While the Apoſtle exhorts us not to <hi>receive the grace of God in vain,</hi> he deſtroyes the fond do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of heretikes, who will have <hi>grace</hi> alone without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation on our behalfe to be ſufficient; whereas out of this very Text the Catholike Church firſt teacheth, that that <hi>Gods grace</hi> offers no violence to our <hi>free will,</hi> but that it comes ſo ſweet unto us, as it is in our powers to reject or receive it, as we pleaſe; and that further we are taught, that by our own free act of cooperation, and this gratuite grace joyned together, we are made gratefull to God, whereas if we have never ſo much grace given us, unleſſe we doe freely cooperate therewith, <hi>it is in vaine received,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayes here in plaine termes, whatſoever Heretikes pretend to the contrary, thereby to make a gap open to their lazy liberties, perſwading themſelves Chriſt hath already ſaved them, and that it boots not, what they doe, ſo they have his <hi>grace</hi> (or rather <hi>Faith</hi> alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his grace) a doctrine diametrically oppoſite to the genuine ſenſe of the Apoſtle in this Text: who by <hi>grace</hi> here underſtands both the generall benefit of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinds redemption, or reconciliation to God by Chriſt his paſſion, and the ſpeciall concourſe of <hi>holy grace,</hi> which Chriſt hath merited for every particular man, and which God conſequently gives to every one, that thereby hee may, (if he will not <hi>in vaine receive it</hi>) make himſelfe an effectuall partaker of the ſaid paſſion of Chriſt, by coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating therewith towards his own Salvation, whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe Chriſt his paſſion remaines onely ſufficient, but not effectuall or actually efficatious to every particular mans Salvation.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. This propheſie reports to the ſecond perſon of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:204830:184"/> Bleſſed Trinity, thus ſpeaking to his heavenly Father, <hi>Jſaias</hi> 49.8. <hi>in the accepted time</hi> of his Incarnation, and in the <hi>ſaving day</hi> of his paſſion, which wrought <hi>Salvation</hi> to the whole world: and when the Apoſtle tells us that now this <hi>acceptable time, this day of Salvation is come,</hi> he meanes, the whole time afforded man in this world, from the houre of our Saviours Incarnation and paſſion, to the very latter day of doome, is all and every minute of it ſo <hi>acceptable,</hi> ſo <hi>ſaving,</hi> that no man can uſe any the leaſt inſtant of it <hi>in vaine,</hi> if he pleaſe to ſerve himſelfe thereof; but may in any time of his whole life (in any inſtant of that whole <hi>time</hi>) by a true converſion of his heart to God, and by an averſion of it from ſinne, ſave his ſoule: though it were huge preſumption in any man, that had enough to doe in all his life to overcome his vices, and would be ſo ſupine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly negligent, as never to convert his Soule (and the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his heart) to God, but at ſome poſting minute, when he could no longer injoy the liberty of ſinne: note alſo, though this be the literall ſenſe of <hi>Iſaias</hi> above, yet the myſticall of it is, that holy Lent is ſingled out as the moſt <hi>acceptable time</hi> in all the year to work out <hi>our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in, becauſe we have then the aſſiſtance of the whole Church joyntly proſtrate with us in <hi>Prayer, Faſting,</hi> and <hi>Pennance;</hi> ſo in caſe our own indeavours come ſhort, yet they may now be carryed on, as ſome men are in crowds, being borne up by others, when they have no footing of their own to carry them along.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Here the Apoſtle ſeemes to put ſo much force in the neceſſity of good life in Chriſtians (ſuch as takes off all note of ſcandall or <hi>offence,</hi>) as if all the labour of the Prieſts were loſt, unleſſe the people did live according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, according to the preaching of the Paſtours; for ſo he concludes, as though their <hi>Miniſtery</hi> might be <hi>blamed,</hi> and queſtioned whether of God or not, if the people did not live vertuous lives, and <hi>without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;</hi> becauſe men would be apt to ſay, they were fine teachers, fine Maſters indeed, who breed up ſuch
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204830:185"/> ſinfull Scholars, as <hi>give offence</hi> to others.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And leſt the people might pretend, it is in vaine for Prieſts to Preach good life, unleſſe they alſo lead the ſame, the Apoſtle both for this reaſon (and further to let them ſee, they were ſeduced, by following ſuch Preachers, as without ordination or Miſſion tooke upon them that <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> and did perhaps ſpeake well, but doe ill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) falls tacitly into an Encomiaſtick of himſelfe, and of all true <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Gods holy word, above what was due to falſe <hi>Miniſters,</hi> by exhorting the people to ſuch good life, as they might ſee example of in him, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, and Diſciples of Chriſt: while he ſaies, <hi>let us ſhew our ſelves</hi> like <hi>Miniſters of God</hi> (inſtructed, ordained, and ſent by him to Preach and lead examples of good life) not obtruded upon the world by man, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Miſſion, and ordination, who had none indeed, and therefore could not truly be called the <hi>Miniſters of God</hi> (as onely the Apoſtles, and their legall ſucceſſours are) all this he means by thoſe words, let us <hi>live as the Miniſters of God:</hi> then he proceeds to tell the Signes, and the Tokens of ſuch, (or at leaſt the effects commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing all ſuch true calling, ordination or miſſion) that it renders them capable of much <hi>patience,</hi> and leſt this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſhould ſeeme but narrowly communicated by God to his Apoſtles, here is an ampliation of it to all Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or occaſions, wherein commonly mens <hi>patiences</hi> are truly tried; that ſo whiles it is not limited to any one oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or circumſtance, but extended to all, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be a mark, or an effect of a <hi>true Miniſter of God,</hi> ſince it is his gift, whoſe every work is perfect, and from this very place to the end of this Epiſtle, the Apoſtle runs on declaring the marks of a <hi>true Miniſter of God,</hi> ſquaring out the excellency and perfection of an Apoſtolicall man, and of his life; ſo that little need more to be ſaid for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the verſes following: now we know they all drive to this end, and are ſpoken in this ſenſe, yet now and then, I ſhall obſerve in each verſe ſomething particular,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204830:185"/> when the ſenſe is deeper then it may ſeem to be at firſt reading.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Note in this verſe the Apoſtle exhorts even in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions (ſuch as was expreſſed above) to uſe volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mortifications, namely, <hi>Watching</hi> and <hi>Faſting,</hi> for they are ſeldom inflicted as puniſhments of our Perſecutors; though even in that ſenſe the hunger of priſons and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nights thereof (cauſed by the unruly company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in ſuch places) may alſo have been glanced at as things the Apoſtle exhorts to bear <hi>patiently.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">6. <hi>Chaſtity</hi> is here of ſpecial regard, becauſe we ſee the Miniſters of other Churches profeſs it is not to be of obligation, nay they wil have it incompatible with humane Nature, and no way poſſible to be preſcribed to Prieſts, or vowed by them: So by this particular mark of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity,</hi> the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth a <hi>true Prieſt</hi> from an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Apoſtolical Miſſion; and gives this as an eminent ſplendour in the Catholick Church, abounding in many thouſands of Prieſts, and Religious perſons of both Sexes, vowing, and moſt of them doubtleſs (if not all) keeping their Vow exactly. <hi>Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Science</hi> is here of ſpecial remark too, ſince it behoves all Prieſts not onely to <hi>know</hi> the common Principles of Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but further the genuine ſenſe of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and deepeſt Myſteries of our Faith; ſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them upon all occaſions to teach, to preach, and to inſtruct the ignorant. By <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> is here underſtood Meekneſs; that ſince they muſt meet with all rudeneſs in nature, and <hi>know</hi> all the harſhneſs of ſinners, they had need of this Vertue to make their Reprehenſions (upon occaſions) more efficacious, by the mildneſs and <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> wherewith they exhort to good, and dehort from evil life.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. By the <hi>Vertue of God</hi> is here meant, either the power whereby ſometimes they work Miracles, or that fortitude wherewith they run through all difficulties in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Chriſtian Perfection. By the <hi>Armour of Juſtice
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:204830:186"/> on the right hand and on the left,</hi> is underſtood on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of proſperity, or adverſity; importing <hi>right</hi> and <hi>left,</hi> as good and bad to us, that we muſt ſtand armed with acts of Vertue, ſuch as may render us juſt to God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere men may imagine of us.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. By <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>diſhonor, infamy</hi> and <hi>good fame,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand whether we are praiſed by others, or undervalued; and here the Apoſtle alludes to his own avoiding vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, when the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> would have ador'd him as a god for his rare parts: Though we are eſteemed <hi>Seducers</hi> (as in time of perſecutions Prieſts are, and as Chriſt himſelf was, who yet could not preach falſe Doctrine, he being Truth it ſelf) yet we muſt not (for that) refrain to preach the Word of God. By <hi>unknown and known,</hi> is meant <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi> to the wicked, whileſt we are <hi>known</hi> to God and our own Conſciences.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. <hi>As dying</hi> (as given over in the opinion of the world for condemned, at the corrupt Tribunals of unjuſt Judges) and <hi>yet alive</hi> to God, to his holy Angels, and to all juſt men, whileſt our cauſe is juſt; like <hi>Chaſtiſed</hi> and <hi>not killed,</hi> either impriſoned, and yet not executed for our Faith, or elſe uſing voluntary moderate Penance, and yet not ſuch as may ſhorten our dayes by death, being too violent, as many times thoſe Penances are which men uſe (without allowance of their Ghoſtly Fathers) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon themſelves.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. <hi>As needy, and yet inriching others,</hi> temporally poor, and yet giving the riches of Spiritual Inſtructions and ghoſtly counſel to our Neighbors; or perhaps the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle might mean literally, whileſt they who had given to them the Oblations of all the Laity in thoſe dayes, yet did not beſtow any thing almoſt upon themſelves, but gave it all away to the poor, and ſo <hi>inriched</hi> them (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed at leaſt their Neceſſities, as <hi>S.

                           <p n="1">1. SEe the Illuſtration of the Prayer above, for the general notions of our Chriſtian Duty this Lenten time: but for the particular, ſee how the Prieſt is ſet before our eyes, for us to imitate the many perfections he is bound unto; the whole Epiſtle being nothing elſe but an Ennumeration of Prieſtly Duties: for then (and not before) we may hope to ſee a Religious Laity, when the Prieſts of holy Church are the Saints they ought to be, ſuch indeed as they are here pointed out unto us.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. And leſt the people ſhould be loſt in ſo large a field of Vertue as the Prieſt is bound to walk in, ſee how the Antiphon before the Prayer culls out the proper Duties of the people during holy Lent: Namely, <hi>Patience, Watching,</hi> and <hi>unſeigned Charity;</hi> that is to ſay, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Prayer, and Almſdeeds. For therefore <hi>Patience</hi> is now recommended, becauſe Mortification is intended, which (to avail us) muſt be born <hi>patiently.</hi> Therefore we are now to <hi>watch,</hi> that we may ſpend more hours then ordinary in our <hi>Prayers,</hi> riſing earlier, and going later to bed in Lent, then at other times. Therefore Alms are accounted <hi>unfeigned Charity,</hi> becauſe men are ever held to love their Neighbors more then Money, when they do relieve the poor.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Thus we ſee no one good work is perfected alone, without the help and company of others.

But we may piouſly believe, Chriſt pleaſed <hi>to be tempted</hi> after Baptiſm, to give Chriſtians an example, that we can no ſooner receive the grace of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are adopted and made his Children, then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the Devil is upon our backs; as alſo to ſhew, the Devil cannot tempt us beyond our power of reſiſtance, if we recur to Prayer, to Faſt, to Reading Scriptures, or the like, as Chriſt did, who made himſelf our example of theſe defences; and to declare beſides, that thoſe who will become Doctors abroad to others, muſt firſt go themſelves Scholars into the School of a vertuous Solitude.</p>

There is much difference between the <hi>forty dayes faſt</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Elias,</hi> and this like <hi>Faſt</hi> of our Saviour: for theirs were performed by the help of an extrinſecal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting grace, this by intrinſical, flowing from the Deity. The cauſes of this <hi>Faſt</hi> were many; As, that thereby he might ſatisfie for <hi>Adams</hi> eating the forbidden Apple; That his own humane Soul might be more apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation by this means; That he might ſanctifie <hi>the Lenten faſt of forty days,</hi> which he knew his Apoſtles would erect and deliver over for the Church to follow until the worlds end, in imitation of this example he had given them. When it is ſaid, <hi>That after forty dayes he was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,</hi> this argues not but he might ſooner have felt the want of meat, however his divinity ſupplyed the defect thereof: and when he was ſenſible of hunger afterwards, it was not that he could no longer faſt, but to have the merit of being tempted againſt his holy purpoſe, and of reſiſting that Temptation, for our future inſtructions in like occaſions.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Tempters <hi>approaching,</hi> argues, he came viſibly in the ſhape of a man, which he had aſſumed; for Chriſt had his internals ſo regulated (as likewiſe <hi>Adam</hi> by Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Juſtice had) that he could not be tempted by any inward Suggeſtion againſt Reaſon: nor was <hi>Adam</hi> (what-ere he might have been) ſo tempted, but by <hi>Eve,</hi> and ſhe by a Serpent outwardly appearing. When the Devil ſaid, <hi>If thou be the Son of God,</hi> it argues he was doubtful of it, for he had heard the voyce from heaven ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi> when Chriſt was Baptized; as alſo he had heard how <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> preached him to be the <hi>Meſſias, the Son of God;</hi> and yet ſeeing him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a man; and finding he was <hi>hungry</hi> (as men are) he tempts him to break his <hi>faſt,</hi> by the ſubtilty of telling him, it would ſhew him to be the <hi>Son of God,</hi> if he would <hi>turn ſtone into bread,</hi> to ſatisfie his <hi>hunger.</hi>

WE had the honour to be called into the field to day by the Lieutenant Generall, the Prieſt of holy Church: but we are led up to the Battaile, by the Captaine Generall himſelfe our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath already vanquiſht all our enemies, for as he dyed to conquer death, and purchaſe us eternall life by dying, ſo by his being tempted, he ſecur'd us of the victory in our Temptations, if we but reſiſt the Temptor, and (perſiſting in our holy purpoſes) Crown the Faſt, with our <hi>Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> therein: ſuch as Jeſus in his hunger gave us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of, although not bound to Faſt as we.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It is a common practiſe of the devill when he cannot tempt to open ſin, to flatter by pretence of ſanctity: and ſo to draw us into the trap of ſelfe-conceit, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vaine glory; thus he (in vaine) attempted Jeſus Chriſt; thus he deludes the ſoules that he tempts to ſin by telling them they are Predeſtinated to be ſav'd, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finally be damn'd, do what they will; the leaſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is remedy to this vaine glorious diſeaſe; <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt thy Lord thy God;</hi> (our Saviours way to kill that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of vaine glory) Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſuch another; <hi>Hee that thinks he ſtands, let him beware he fall not.

                           <p n="3">3. The latter end of all Temptation ſhewes the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors aime, the ruine of the tempted ſoule.

                           <p>Chriſt came not here to raigne, but to beſtow on us a Crown of glory; to rob us then of heaven, the devill prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us the ſcum thereof, the rubbige ſwept away from thence, and caſt into the common ſhoare, the ſinke of nature, Earth. <hi>O how ſordid earth appeares, when I behold the beauty of the heavens;</hi> thus holy <hi>David,</hi> thus we ought to ſay, and more, with Jeſus, bid the <hi>fiend avant;</hi> ſo ſhall we by <hi>religious adoration</hi> of Almighty God accompany'd with <hi>holy Poverty</hi> this time of Lent, forbear to covet riches (and by them to Idolize unto the devill) adde then theſe good workes to the Faſt they will accompliſh,

                           <p>THe laſt Sundayes Prayer laid our Lenten Faſt for the chiefe ground of all the Prayers in Lent. <hi>This</hi> (fixed on that ground) lookes to the end of the aforeſaid Faſt, <hi>our purification</hi> of the whole creature which we are;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:204830:191"/> and ſo confeſſing here firſt, that <hi>we are void of all ſtrength to guard</hi> our ſelves, we begge of Almighty God a <hi>guard</hi> both for the <hi>exterior</hi> and <hi>interior</hi> man; that thus our <hi>bodies</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outwardly <hi>defended from all corporall adverſities</hi> (parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſickneſſe, to tempt us from our Faſt) <hi>our ſoules may be purified from all inward evills</hi> of filthy <hi>cogitations;</hi> and this with regard to what Saint <hi>Leo</hi> told us laſt Sunday, was required for the integrity of a Faſt, namely to withdraw our minds from ſinne, leſt in vaine we did elſe take meat from our mouths: and hence we ſhall finde <q>little excuſe by what caſuiſts tell us, the end of the precept is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to us, though the meanes to that end be of abſolute command: for example in this preſent caſe,</q> they ſay, tis no breach of our Lenten Faſt to commit a ſinne in Lent, though we are commanded to uſe the meanes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, to the end we may avoid ſinne, and ſo render our ſelves the <hi>purified creatures,</hi> which holy Church intends by this forty dayes Faſt to make us: for truly caſuiſts in this may ſeeme to favour us, but yet upon reflection it is no favour, becauſe ſinne being at all times prohibited under ſtrict command, we never ſinne mortally, but we breake ſome precept of Almighty God, greater then this of the Church, by any other kind of mortall ſinning, which at all times is forbid us; and then much more ſtrictly, when we are actually under a wholeſome cure for ſinne, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faſt of Lent: ſo it will not be to render ſoules ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but religious, to tell them that ſinnes are aggravated at leaſt, when committed at that time, we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take Phyſick for preventing ſinne; as now, when holy Church injoynes a Faſt expreſſely for that purpoſe: But to our maine deſigne, let us ſee how this dayes Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſuits to the Epiſtle and Goſpell of the day, as well as to the ſeaſon of Lent; why truly very well to the <hi>former,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Lenten Faſting is one of the Apoſtolicall <hi>precepts</hi> mentioned here by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians;</hi> and in regard Faſting is one of the beſt of remedies againſt that carnall ſinne, which this dayes Epiſtle dehorteth from; as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:204830:191"/> alſo it is the beſt ſtep to that <hi>walk,</hi> recommended to us from <hi>vertue to vertue,</hi> that we may by <hi>abounding more and more</hi> therein, <hi>pleaſe God,</hi> by the fulfilling of <hi>his holy will,</hi> which is (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to day calls it) <hi>our Sanctification,</hi> and that particularly by the gift of <hi>chaſtity,</hi> of <hi>purity both in body and ſoule,</hi> which altogether comes home even to the letter, and full ſenſe of this dayes Prayer: nor is the Goſpell of the Transfiguration read to day for any other end, then to mind us of being ſpiritually transfigured from Polluted to Chaſte bodies, from Sinful to Sainted Soules; for ſo ſhall we appeare to our Saviours eye, with <hi>faces ſhining</hi> like the Sunne, and <hi>bodies pure</hi> as <hi>the whiteſt Snow,</hi> as himſelfe appeared on Mount-Tabor to his Apoſtles, and as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors conceive <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did appear ſo too; thus to ſhew we cannot by our vertuous lives approach neer to God, without being Transfigured to the world, and made mirrours of admiration to men and Angels, and ſuch indeed ought to be our Lenten Faſters.

Saying, <hi>why ſtand ye here the whole day idle?</hi> as if to ſtand ſtill were to be idle and loyter: ſo the poſture of a good Chriſtian is and ought to be <hi>walking,</hi> moving, going on <hi>from vertue to vertue,</hi> Pſal. 38. untill at laſt he arrive to the rewarder and ſource of all vertues, God himſelfe: for by bidding us to <hi>walk</hi> ſo, as thereby we may <hi>pleaſe God</hi> and <hi>abound more and more,</hi> we are bid to accumulate vertues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vertues, ſo long as we live in this vicious world; and that we may know how to doe this, the Apoſtle bids, that we follow his rule for this purpoſe framed to our hands, as it was to the <hi>Theſſalonians;</hi> ſince what he writ to them was with intention it ſhould be handed over from age to age, even to us, and to thoſe that ſhould live in the very laſt of times.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. His meaning is, that he <hi>gave them</hi> this rule of <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

                           <p n="4">4.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:204830:193"/> God hath elevated that corporal communication (ſo much coveted and delighted in by Fleſh and Bloud) that he hath raiſed the wonted civill contract of marriage to be now a more holy thing, even a Sacrament or conduite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe of his holy grace into the Soules of ſuch people, as make religious and not luſtfull uſe thereof: for of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſee ſad examples in the ſeven husbands of <hi>Sara,</hi> ſnatched from her bed, becauſe they marryed her purely for luſt, not for any limited or regulated love: and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by a pious abſtinence upon faſts or feaſts, from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall knowledge of each other, ſpecially when marryed Chriſtians receive the Sacrament, they uſe <hi>their veſſels in Sanctification</hi> of themſelves, <hi>and honour</hi> of God thereby, for reverence to whoſe bleſſed Body and holy Sacraments they abſtaine from their otherwiſe lawfull pleaſures: yet there is a deeper and more univerſall application aimed at by the Apoſtle in this place, even to all Chriſtians whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever married or ſingle; ſince though to marryed perſons their mutually betrothed bodies to one another are <hi>their veſſels</hi> properly here ſpecified, yet to ſingle perſons by <hi>their veſſels,</hi> are meant their ſingle bodies, which containe their ſoules within them, as ſo many precious liquors in the ſight, and to the Palat of Almighty God, who is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, leſt any of that liquour ſhould be drawne out, and given to creatures; that is, leſt by following the impulſe of ſenſe, they ſhould poure out the affections of their ſoules upon their own corporall pleaſures, or the delight of any other body whatſoever, for pure reſpect to the creature, and not ſo ſtand upon their guard, as not to part with the leaſt drop of their ſoules affections, either to themſelves or any others, which are all due to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God; for this is to <hi>poſſeſſe each one his owne veſſell,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 v. 19.

                           <p n="6">6. In this place the Apoſtles ſenſe lyes lyable to a very eaſie miſtake, and the words ſound, as if he did leap from the Subject of luſt, to that of fraud, deceipt or injury, but indeed he proſecutes his former ſenſe in this whole Epiſtle: So he muſt here be underſtood <hi>by buſineſſe</hi> to forbid <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> as above he hath forbidden <hi>Fornication; not to overgo</hi> is here meant literally, forbidding any man to <hi>goe over</hi> his neighbours <hi>marriage bed,</hi> and thereby defraud him of his due, which is to have his wife wholly and ſolely to his own ſingle uſe; and <hi>by buſineſſe</hi> is not here underſtood traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, bargaine, ſale, law or the like, but properly that <hi>buſineſſe</hi> which is betweene man and wife, their mutuall accompanying one another in the Act of wedlock, becauſe <hi>our Lord</hi> will in a particular way <hi>revenge</hi> (and commonly he doth it by ſome curſe upon the children of Adulterous parents) <hi>this wrong,</hi> for as much as it is a ſpeciall abuſe <hi>to God</hi> to violate the Faith of marriage bed, ſince by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of marriage is repreſented the union betweene Chriſt and his ſpouſe the holy Church; and conſequently, ſince for that reaſon men <hi>are bid to love their wives, as Chriſt doth love his Church,</hi> and wives their husbands, as the Church loves Chriſt, ſo to violate the ſigne of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly union, is to attempt an <hi>adultery</hi> even betweene Chriſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:204830:194"/> and his holy ſpouſe, ſince they who are diſloyall to their marriage bed, can no more be, what they are appointed <hi>by God</hi> for, repreſenters of Chriſt his fidelity to holy Church, and of the Churches loyalty to him.</p>
                           <p n="7">7.

The reaſon why he took <hi>theſe three Apoſtles</hi> onely, was to ſhew, he had ſpecial regard to each of them more then ordinary; to <hi>Peter,</hi> as the head of all the reſt; to <hi>James,</hi> as honored with the Title of our Saviours Brother, for being like him in perſon, and ſo left his ſucceſſor at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> where <hi>James</hi> was the firſt Biſhop after Chriſt his death, and firſt Martyr of the Apoſtles: to <hi>John,</hi> as his favourite, being known by the title of that Diſciple <hi>whom Jeſus loved:</hi> Theſe <hi>three</hi> therefore Chriſt ſingles out, and carries them <hi>into a high Mountain,</hi> called <hi>Thabor,</hi> near to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where Chriſt was bred up, and not far from <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where he wrought his moſt Miracles; <hi>high,</hi> to ſhew heaven is hugely elevated from earth, and that, as in heaven the glory of God ſhall be, ſo in <hi>Thabor</hi> the glory of Chriſt was manifeſted to thoſe, who were (like the Elect, amongſt many choſen) ſingled out for eternal happineſs, in the next, and for teſtimonies here of Chriſt his Deity, ſhining through the cloud of his humanity, as the next verſe deſcribeth.</p>

All Expoſitors ſay, this was a ſpeech of a man half beſide himſelf, drunk, as it were, with the preſent glut of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not forecaſting future things; beſides that it was impertinent to <hi>build Tabernacles</hi> for thoſe whom he ſaw in glory, as alſo it was to fix Chriſt upon earth, and in <hi>Thabor,</hi> who came to purchaſe heaven for all the world by his paſſion (which by his remaining here had been prevented) and to hope for heaven before himſelf had laboured to deſerve it, or to think eternal Beatitude conſiſted in the glory of Chriſts humanity, and not in the beholding of his Deity, which here they did not ſee.</p>

The interpoſition of this <hi>Cloud</hi> upon this ſpeech, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a check given to the ſpeaker thereof, by depriving him of that alluring ſight, which he knew not how to make right uſe of, but not ſeparating them from a due diſtance both to ſee and hear, whence they fell (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſayes) into a <hi>preſent fear;</hi> yet this <hi>Cloud</hi> was <hi>clear,</hi> to ſhew the difference betwixt the Old Law and the New, <hi>That</hi> being delivered to <hi>Moſes</hi> in a dark cloud, <hi>This</hi> avow'd to be delivered by Chriſt, before <hi>Moſes, Elias,</hi> and <hi>theſe three Apoſtles,</hi> in a <hi>clear</hi> reſplendent <hi>Cloud;</hi> out of which was heard the <hi>voyce</hi> of God the Father, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, &amp;c.</hi> Some think <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were gone, before this voyce was heard, leſt the Apoſtles might doubt, to which of the <hi>three</hi> it was ſpoken: but ſince they were to be both eye and ear-witneſſes too, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, they might ſee to whom the addreſs was made, and queſtionleſs God did make this teſtimony ſuch, as could not be lyable to doubt, ſince he was pleaſed to have theſe Witneſſes of the thing, as he made them, ſaying, <hi>Hear him,</hi> that is, <hi>Hear my beloved Son,</hi> for from his mouth, not from the mouth of <hi>Moſes and Elias,</hi> ſhall proceed all Truth and Salvation to Mankind. The reaſon why this command of <hi>hearing him,</hi> was not added when he was ſtiled by the like <hi>voyce</hi> from heaven, to be <hi>Son</hi> to the ſame Father, at his Baptiſm, was becauſe then he was onely ſhewed to be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:204830:197"/> the Meſſias, whom men before conceived the Baptiſt to have been: But here he is in preſence of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> preferred in point of Doctrine before them, as if all they had ſaid or done was but to prefigure him, but that what he ſayes, reports to none beſide himſelf, as having vigour in it, to make him known to be the Illuminator of all the former Prophets, and ſo of himſelf, the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of Nations, and Law-maker thereunto, whence he (for his own ſake) is to be heard, others for reſpect one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, and there was reaſon to ſay, <hi>Hear him,</hi> that comes to abrogate the Old, and to make a New Law, to dye for the ſins of his people, in ſuch exceſs of ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as <hi>he</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> did but now talk of, to riſe from the dead himſelf, and thereby to impower all men to riſe again (after they are dead) to the Judgement Seat, where thoſe, that till then believe it not, ſhall finde there is a Hell, and thoſe who are believers ſhall know there is a Purgatory, and a <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> was from the latter ſummoned hither to this Myſtery of <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> which was exhibited as an undoubted teſtimony of the Truths that were preached by him, whom we were then commanded <hi>to hear,</hi> and conſequently to believe.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. They <hi>feared</hi> at the ſhrilneſs of the voyce, though ſweet, at the loſs of the ſight they had before of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they might ſuſpect were ſent away, to fulminate vengeance from God upon the people, who had abuſed his <hi>beloved Son,</hi> and hence <hi>fearing,</hi> they <hi>fell upon their faces,</hi> to ſhew, they were themſelves ready to adore him.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. And Jeſus pitying the fright they were in, <hi>came</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to comfort them, and <hi>raiſe</hi> them up again from the poſture of their proſtration, thereby to ſhew, we cannot ſooner humble our ſelves to God, then he is ready to raiſe a comfort in us.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. The reaſon why they then ſee <hi>none but Jeſus,</hi> was, becauſe now all things were given up to his cure, no more rigorous Law was to terrifie the people, the ſweet Law
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:204830:197"/> of grace was to be their guide, he alone their comfort; ſo that to him they were to ſtand firme in all diſtreſſes, of him to receive all reliefes, and by him to be brought fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to the eternity of that heavenly glory, which here the Apoſtles had but a tranſient glimmering of; thereby to ſhew this is not a time or place for comforts, but rather for afflictions, and that leſt we ſhould be dejected by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes in affliction we may hope for the intervening comfort now and then of myſticall <hi>Transfigurations,</hi> by which we ſhall (for a ſhort time) take content in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, but they paſſing away againe, are to leave us unto the trials of new afflictions, till by frequent confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of our wills, to the pleaſure of Almighty God, we be rewarded with eternall glory, for our patient enduring the many Eclypſes we found here of heavenly comforts in our Soules, by the interpoſition of earthly tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. By bidding them tell <hi>this viſion to no body,</hi> he forbids their ſpeaking of it not onely to the people, but even to the reſt of the Apoſtles, leſt it might trouble them, not to have been preſent at it; and by his reſurrection, all men would be eaſily made beleeve he was God, who, if they had been told it before, would have doubted thereof, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they ſee him dead and buried: ſo to ſpeak of this Teſtimony of his Deity before his reſurrection, were labour loſt: but by this injoyning ſilence of his glory, and propalation of his death and paſſion, Chriſt gave us an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable example to conceale our own praiſes, and to be content with publication of preſſures and infirmities, ſince none can have any infamy ſo great to him, as was the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy of the Croſſe to Chriſt, wherein we ſee he glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whileſt he ſuppreſſed the fame of his glory, till he had ſuffered the ignominy of his moſt opprobrious death: hence Saint <hi>Paul forbids himſelfe all other glory, then in that of the Croſſe of Chriſt:</hi> a good leſſon for all good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to learne, and practice to be perfect in.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. And thus, it will be proper enough, ſince we are taught the Transfiguration was at leaſt a tranſient viſion beatificall, ſuch as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> held to be a kinde of Heaven, where he was content to build a Tabernacle of aboad: and look how unable we are to be <hi>chaſte,</hi> ſo are we in our ſelves <hi>void of all ſtrength</hi> to goe to Heaven; and have need of a world of guards both <hi>interior and exterior,</hi> to preſerve us from the <hi>corporall adverſities</hi> (or ſins) that keep us thence, or from the ſpirituall ſins <hi>of evill thoughts</hi> that ſhut up Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Gates againſt us.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To conclude, ſince nothing makes our way ſecurer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, then to carry a <hi>Pure</hi> Soule in a <hi>Chaſte</hi> body, (we being taught <hi>the cleane of heart, are therefore bleſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall ſee God,</hi> for this cauſe the Goſpel of the <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration</hi> was very fitly joyned to the Epiſtle of <hi>chaſtity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Chaſte</hi> Body is that Tranſient Heaven upon Earth, which is moſt delightfull to a pure Soule.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:204830:199"/> Sundays Prayer of Lent, to be the end of this holy faſt; and finding it thereto be our <hi>purification,</hi> we ſhal ſoon conclude that ſelfe ſame end is ſtill and ought ever to be <hi>our deſires</hi> all the Lent long: becauſe the continuation of the Faſting Medium, argues our conſtant <hi>deſire</hi> of arriving at the end, to which it drives, our being <hi>Purified</hi> by that meanes. So thus we ſee the Torrent of our holy Faſt runs never the leſſe ſlowly on, becauſe it makes not a noyſe in our eares, rather it growes the deeper, by how much leſſe we heare thereof: for ſhallow waters are thoſe that tell us of the ſtones they fall upon, but deep ones ſilently goe by: nor is the ſtile of <hi>humble people</hi> any common place, but hugely proper to this time of Lent, which drawes the whole Chriſtian world upon their knees, and not content to have them low as earth, while they Faſting watch and pray, did in a manner bury them below the earth, when on Aſhwedneſday, they were all Sprinkled o're with holy Aſhes, as if they were not worthy longer to be the upper earth, that had ſo proudly rebelled againſt Almighty God, but muſt lye lower now, and hope by falling downe to riſe againe: and truly if we reflect upon the words of this Prayer, they are exact termes of a moſt <hi>humble</hi> Soule, who dares not ſay, ſhe hath a will to faſt on ſtill, and to be <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> but onely tels Almighty God, 'tis her <hi>deſire,</hi> and hopes <hi>this humble</hi> expreſſion will make it be his holy will, ſhe ſhall obtaine her <hi>deſires,</hi> becauſe his onely <hi>looking</hi> on it (as ſhe <hi>humbly</hi> prayes to day, he will) is able to effect it: But leſt we forget to ſhew the Prayer ſuits as well to the Epiſtle and Goſpell, as to the time of Lent, we muſt remember no termes could more directly exhauſt them both, then what this Prayer is couched in: For how can we be <hi>followers</hi> elſe of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us to be with the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> unleſſe we ſhew our ſelves to have learned the leſſon of the Son of God without book; <hi>Learne of me, that am meeke and humble of heart;</hi> which leſſon this dayes Prayer repeats, when holy Church cals us <hi>the humble people of Almighty God,</hi> and <hi>meekneſſe</hi> ever goes with

                              <hi>humility</hi> hand in hand: ſo having ſet our firſt ſtep right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the track of this Epiſtle, we need not fear the miſſing of our way; for true humility hath root in <hi>love,</hi> and will not ſtumble at an enemy, unleſſe it be to fall upon him with a kiſſe, deſiring him to riſe from dangers way, and leave us to run his hazard, whoſe ſins are greater then any his can be: ſay now, beloved, which of you cannot goe on through all the counſels of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epiſtle, when with Chriſt your charity hath laid you humbly at the feet of your enemies, and made you now offer your ſelves an oblation to <hi>him,</hi> that before you hated. Bleſſed God! how ſmall a Key opens a great doore into devotion, when diligent Soules will once vouchſafe to turn it: I dare ſay, there is not one ſyllable in all this whole Epiſtle, which this Prayer thus applyed unto it, will not correſpond withall. And to the Goſpell what more ſuitable, then to beg help of Gods <hi>right hand</hi> for thoſe <hi>humble people</hi> in the valleys of the Church, where the devill playes his pranks, as ſoone as God Almighty turnes his face up to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, where his Speculative Saints abide: for thus we ſee it was literally with thoſe in the vales below, when Chriſt upon Mount <hi>Thabor</hi> was <hi>Transfigured before Peter, James, and John,</hi> as if the devil had ſpyed his time, when Jeſus face was turned up to heaven, and then the feind preſumes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into thoſe below: ſo to prevent the like being poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this our valley of miſery, we are taught by holy Church to day, to pray that <hi>God will looke upon the deſires of his humble people, and extend the right hand of his Majeſty in our defence:</hi> nor is any hand indeed ſtrong enough, to wreſt us from the devils clutches, but the <hi>right hand</hi> of God himſelfe.</p>

HE had ended the laſt Chapter before this, in ſhewing them how mercifully and lovingly God in Chriſt had forgiven their offences, and ſo there he bid them likewiſe forgive each other; whereupon he now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds ſaying, <hi>Be therefore followers of God</hi> in this example of remitting to each other your offences, as ſhewing therein you are moſt <hi>deare Children unto God,</hi> by letting the world ſee, you follow his example, and in following it give a teſtimony to the world, that you are indeed <hi>moſt deere</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whileſt he gives you that grace, which above all others makes you <hi>deere,</hi> namely the grace to imitate and follow him, in a practiſe ſo much above fleſh and bloud, as it demonſtrates, there is more then man in thoſe who can arrive to this perfection, that is, a likeneſſe unto God himſelfe, whoſe ſpeciall attribute is <hi>mercy,</hi> as tranſcending (in our eyes) all the reſt of his workes.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. And ſince this <hi>mercy</hi> is radicated in <hi>love</hi> (for it muſt needs be <hi>love,</hi> that produceth this effect) therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle proſecutes his exhortation to this <hi>mercy,</hi> by bidding us, not onely once be mercifull, but <hi>walk,</hi> (continually perſiſt and live) in acts of the ſame love, which produce mercy in us; and this continuation of <hi>love</hi> is ſhewed to be meant by <hi>walking</hi> in it, when the next words in this verſe import the ſame, elſe they would not bid us <hi>walk in love,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt did,</hi> who when once <hi>he loved us</hi> did <hi>love</hi> us to the end, as is even here proved, when it is ſaid, <hi>he delivered himſelfe up for us an oblation and hoſt to God,</hi> to ſhew that as his <hi>love</hi> continued to his <hi>lifes</hi> end, ſo conſequently it muſt continue to eternity, ſince by his death he gave himſelfe (and his affections to us both together) up into the hands of his eternall Father, and in eternity there neither is, nor can be any change: ſo the Apoſtle might have added, <hi>hee loved</hi> us not onely unto <hi>the end,</hi> but even beyond it, that is to ſay, without end, ſince his life did end with an Act of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:204830:201"/> ſuch undoubted <hi>love,</hi> as never can have end. Bleſſed God! how this ought to animate us, that we ſee our ſelves made capable to imitate Almighty God, though not in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, nor greatneſſe, yet in his humility, meekneſſe, and <hi>love,</hi> whileſt his Sacred Son gave us examples thereof, thereby to dignifie us with the title, of not onely <hi>his,</hi> but even <hi>Gods own followers,</hi> ſince by doing what Chriſt did, who was God, as well as man, we unite, and, as it were, identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Soules to God, as Chriſt his humanity was united and made one perſon with his Sacred Deity; not that our perſons can be made one with God, but that our <hi>loves</hi> may be united to his <hi>love</hi> by being the ſame to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as Chriſts was to us: and if we will inſtance in the beſt example of this imitation, it is when we are content to dye for our neighbors Soules, as Chriſt did dye for us; for that was indeed <hi>an odour of ſweetneſſe to God,</hi> when his onely and beloved Son was Sacrificed unto him; and the like <hi>odour of ſweetneſſe</hi> doe the martyrs of holy Church ſend up to God, when to confirme the Faith they have ſetled in Chriſtian Soules, they are content to dye examples for them, to doe the like, rather then to deſert their Faith.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And now the Apoſtle hath told them, what they moſt doe to imitate (and thereby to pleaſe) God in the higheſt degree, he proceeds to tell them what they muſt avoid and flye from, as they would flye from the face of a devill, namely <hi>Fornication,</hi> &amp;c. which he will not allow ſo much as to <hi>be named,</hi> or be in the mouth of a Chriſtian, leſt it ſhould be thought to come from his heart, ſince <hi>the mouth ſpeaketh</hi> commonly <hi>out of the abundance of the hearts</hi> affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but bids us flye ſuch ſins, <hi>as it becometh Saints</hi> to doe, thoſe who by their Baptiſme, vocation, and profeſſion are truly conſecrated <hi>Saints to God,</hi> and therefore muſt not give the leſt ſuſpicion, that they goe retrograde, back to the devill againe, by degenerating from that conſtant <hi>ſanctity</hi> of heart, which ought to ſhine in every action, word or thought of a Chriſtian: note we ſhall explicate <hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleaneſſe</hi> in the Epiſtle on the fourteenth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:204830:201"/> Sunday after Pentecoſt; <hi>avarice</hi> ſhall be explicated anon in the fifth verſe, of this Epiſtle, ſo we now proceed to the fourth verſe as it here followes in order.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. By <hi>Filthineſſe</hi> is here underſtood obſcaenity of words, for <hi>uncleanneſſe</hi> is properly that which is obſcaenity in deeds or actions; by <hi>fooliſh talk</hi> is underſtood waſting time in any impertinent diſcourſe, that doth not tend to edification of our neighbour, by ſome report or other to Almighty God but buſies the mind in idleneſſe, as the fooliſh virgins were buſied, who not ſo much for doing ill, as for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, for <hi>fooling</hi> away their time, were ſhut out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo all the diſcourſe may be called <hi>fooliſh,</hi> that doth not tend to God more or leſſe. By <hi>Scurrility</hi> is here properly underſtood ruſticity or rudeneſſe in diſcourſe, not onely where it is wanton or obſcene (to which onely ſence ſome men ignorantly apply the word <hi>Scurrility</hi>) but when it is redundant (nauſeating the hearer) unproper to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in hand, and to the company preſent, or indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly, and ſo offenſive to them, when too too ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as procuring laughter upon any ill choſen Subject, but principally and above all, when it is breaking Jeſts out of holy Scripture, or the Fathers, or Councels, and ſo making Sacred things the Subject of an idle end, which is to raiſe laughter and mirth, from that which ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us moſt ſober and ſerious, whence is grounded that <hi>axiome, it is ill manners</hi> (beſides that thereof can come no good) <hi>to jeſt and ſcoffe at Holy Things;</hi> and of <hi>Scurrility</hi> in all theſe ſences as above, the Apoſtles next ſentence is, that it is <hi>nothing to the purpoſe,</hi> meaning nothing at all tending to the Salvation of our Soules, which is (and ought to be) alwayes the ſcope of all our words, of our thoughts and actions: not that by this the Apoſtle forbids civill mirth, ſuch as relaxeth the fixed ſobriety of our minds, meerly for honeſt recreation ſake, for ſuch mirth is lawfull, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending neither God nor Man: but <hi>Scurrility</hi> is ever to be avoided; and inſtead of that unlawfull way of mirth in our diſcourſe, the Apoſtle exhorteth to <hi>giving God thanks,</hi>
                              <pb n="42" facs="tcp:204830:202"/> that is by praiſing his goodneſſe, ſhewed either to our ſelves or others in his marvellous providence over all the world; for this is a ſcope ſo ample, as will ever give abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant way to diſcourſe, and ſo laudable, as no man can be offended at it.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. In this verſe the Apoſtle ſums up what he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forbidden, and tels us that no ſuch perſons as theſe can hope for <hi>heaven,</hi> his meaning is, by being ſuch, not but that when they leave and repent, they may be ſaved: but here by <hi>the covetous perſon,</hi> he puts us in mind of what he meant in the third verſe above by <hi>Avarice,</hi> namely <hi>Jdolatry</hi> of the minde, for as much as <hi>covetous perſons</hi> make their money their <hi>Idol God:</hi> I ſay <hi>Jdolatry</hi> of minde, or rather <hi>Spirituall Jdolatry,</hi> becauſe I would ſhew how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently Heretikes tranſlate this place of Scripture, when thereby they underſtand the prohibition of Images, or pictures in the Churches, which is very far from the ſence of this Text, where the Apoſtle forbids to make <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches our God;</hi> for ſo he means by calling <hi>Avarice</hi> adoration of <hi>Jdols;</hi> and ſuch it might be in Catholikes, if they did ſet up their baggs of gold in Churches, and worſhip them; but who ever heard, they were ſo fond, or how can they by worſhipping pictures, in memory of the God or Saints they repreſent, be ſaid to love the pictures, as the covetous man doth his Idoll, his Golden God.</p>
                           <p>But we are to note here by <hi>Avarice</hi> annexed to <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſſe,</hi> the Apoſtle glaunceth at a huge exceſſe of <hi>luſt,</hi> ſuch as makes mens mindes long after car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, as covetouſneſſe doth fix them wholly upon hoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up of riches, and as ſuch covetous men care not to cozen others for lucre of ſordid gaine, ſo men wholly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to luſt, care not to cozen other men of their wives, and engroſſe them to their own adulterous ends: and this kind of exceſſe in luſt is properly called <hi>Carnall Avarice,</hi> becauſe as the covetous man is never ſatisfied with gaine, ſo is this luſtfull minde never ſatiated, though the body be rendred even unable to act the deſires of a beſtiall minde:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:204830:202"/> whence the Apoſtle properly cals it <hi>Spirituall Jdolatry,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a man is alwayes adoring this Idoll of his luſt.</p>
                           <p>It is a pretty art the Apoſtle uſeth in the cloſe of this verſe, to put <hi>the Kingdome of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>of God</hi> together, as one joynt thing; meaning that thoſe who with Chriſt here are humble, obedient, and holy, ſhall in heaven be exhalted, rewarded, and glorified with him.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The Apoſtles meaning here is, that whoſoever tels you, it is needleſſe to avoyd your ſwing of pleaſures in this world, provided you but beleeve, <hi>doth ſeduce</hi> and <hi>cheat you,</hi> and therefore, be not, ſaith he, carryed away with their <hi>vaine words,</hi> who would pretend to make you good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by Faith alone, though you did not depoſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Sordid Gentiliſme of your former corrupted manners, and lives; theſe are indeed ſpecious, but falſe allurements, ſo we muſt take heed, we be not cheated by them, becauſe for Chriſtians continuing their ſinfull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by relying onely upon Faith alone, as ſufficient to ſave them; we often ſee the preſent effect of Gods <hi>anger</hi> upon them, by the puniſhments inflicted either on their perſons, or on their Children and Family even in this life, and that is meant by the <hi>anger of God</hi> here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fall upon the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>diffidence,</hi> namely thoſe who are not here confiding in God, that he will accept of our renouncing ill manners for his ſake, as well as our <hi>infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> for in the next life there can be no diffidence, when the truth of all things, ſhall be known to all in generall, and none can doubt, or diſtruſt what they ought to doe, but ſhall either receive reward or puniſhment for what they have already done.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Here good Chriſtians are forbidden the <hi>participation</hi> with lewd ones, not in their perſons, but in their vices.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. And that upon no leſſe penalty then of falling back into the ſame <hi>darkneſſe</hi> they were in, before they were converted, when Gentiliſme or Infidelity did not forbid them ſuch lewd courſes, but held them in the <hi>darke</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, there was no ſin in liberty of life, or rather in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:204830:203"/> the licentiouſneſſe thereof; and for this opinions ſake, the Apoſtle calls the men that hold it, <hi>darkneſſe</hi> it ſelfe; and contrary-wiſe thoſe who depoſe ſuch errors, and become true beleevers, he cals them <hi>light,</hi> becauſe they following the <hi>light</hi> of grace, become <hi>light</hi> it ſelfe; as therefore you are <hi>light,</hi> ſo <hi>walk</hi> like <hi>children</hi> thereof, in the <hi>light</hi> of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſanctity of life.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. <hi>For the fruit of the light is</hi> (that is to ſay, conſiſteth) <hi>in all goodneſſe,</hi> meaning in benignity and bounty to others, and in <hi>juſtice,</hi> giving to each his due, not defrauding, as above the covetous men were ſaid to doe, and in <hi>verity</hi> is oppoſite to hypocriſie and lying; that ſo by theſe contrary vertues to the vices of Infidels, you may (as by their fruits trees are knowne) be diſtinguiſhed from children of <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> while you bring forth the <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>light.</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. BY the Illuſtration of this dayes Prayer, we ſee how the aime of our Purification is proſecuted therein; nor can there be a greater Purifier, then the Fire of perfect <hi>Love and Charity,</hi> the vertue recommended in the two firſt verſes of this Epiſtle, as neceſſary to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lenten Faſt.</p>
                           <p n="2">2.

                           <p n="3">3. Now in regard the Fire of <hi>Charity</hi> muſt be fetcht as far as Heaven, and <hi>handed</hi> to us by Almighty God himſelf, the chief Purifier of our Hearts; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard theſe evils (above mentioned) are ſo weighty, and

<q>Therefore we pray as above, to have theſe things done for us, by <hi>extending the Right hand</hi> of God, firſt to give us this <hi>Charity,</hi> and next to defend us from theſe Evils, by taking them away from us, that ſo we may be bright ſhining <hi>purified</hi> Souls, as the cloſe of the Epiſtle exhorts us to be.</q>

                           <p n="14">14. NOte, this poſſeſſed party was one and the ſame, of whom S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 22. that was both <hi>blinde and dumb,</hi> though S. <hi>Luke</hi> makes onely mention of his <hi>dumbneſs,</hi> which is not to contradict the other Evangeliſt, unleſs he had ſaid, he was <hi>onely blinde</hi> and not <hi>dumb:</hi> whereas to ſpeak of one effect of his being poſſeſſed, and let alone the other, is no contradiction at all, as ſome would have it to be. Note alſo, this <hi>dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is not underſtood to be natural, or rather a defect of Nature from the birth of the party, but onely accidental, and a meer effect of the Devils poſſeſſing him with a <hi>dumbneſs,</hi> but not any other defect in Nature: for ſuch a <hi>dumbneſs</hi> is not cured by caſting our a Devil, but by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out ſome ſtring, that ties the Tongue up, and gives it not leave to play according to the exigence of ſpeech or elſe by curing the <hi>deafneſs,</hi> if it be from the birth, for all ſuch deafneſs conſequently cauſeth <hi>dumbneſs,</hi> becauſe ſpeech is learnt by hearing the ſound others make with ſpeaking, or otherwiſe; and thus imitating the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which doth beget ſpeech: So this cure was wrought by Chriſt taking away the impediment, which the Devil had by his power put in the parties ſpeech; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that impediment being gone, by caſting out the Devil who was cauſe thereof, the party ſpake imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, without addition of any other Miracle at all: though what S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſayes Rhetorically of this paſſage is not falſe neither, but a pious ampliation of the Truth, by declaring the conſequences of one thing when he ſaid, <q>Three Miracles together are wrought in one perſon: for the <hi>blinde</hi> man <hi>ſaw,</hi> the <hi>dumb</hi> man <hi>ſpake,</hi> and the <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> had his <hi>devil caſt out.</hi>
                              </q> The cloſe of this verſe argues the poſſeſſed was not born <hi>dumb,</hi> for to that cure no <hi>devils being caſt out</hi> was neceſſary, as we ſaid
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204830:205"/> before; and therefote as ſoon as he was caſt out, the party <hi>ſpake</hi> to the <hi>admiration of all</hi> the people, (who could not then force him to <hi>ſpeak</hi>) though happily they had heard him do it often, before he was poſſeſſed.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. See the malice of the wicked, to attribute Gods power to the <hi>devil,</hi> rather then glorifie <hi>God,</hi> by giving him the due praiſe of his own wonderful works: And while they tell him, he works in the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> they vilifie him all they can, to ſhew the little they attribute to his own power, how little they think him God, or of God; ſince <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> in the Hebrew Tranſlation, ſignifies the god of Flies; and they being the moſt abject and inconſiderable things in nature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to attribute no more Power to Chriſt, then to a Fly, is to undervalue him all they can: nor doth it magnifie him, that <hi>Beelzebub</hi> is here called the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> more then it were to magnifie a man, to call him the Prince of Flyes, unleſs it be any kinde of honor to have a man called the beſt of Flyes, as <hi>Beelzebub</hi> is therefore Prince of thoſe Devils, who rule over that contemptible Creature the Fly: not that the Devil hath any proper dominion over any Creatures, but that the <hi>Accaronites,</hi> when they were troubled with a Plague of Flyes, erected an Idol, which they called <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> that is, God of Flyes; and to feed them in this Idolatry, upon ſuch Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations the <hi>Devil</hi> did many times eaſe them of theſe Plagues the Flyes cauſed amongſt them; though in the Greek <hi>Beelzebub</hi> ſignifies the god of Muck or Dung: and yet that is not inconſiſtent with the ſenſe as above; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where Dung is, there are alwayes Flyes; and ſo the <hi>Devil</hi> is by this name called both God of Flyes and of Dung too: ſince the ordure of Sin is far more naſty, then that of any dung can be.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. This Verſe will in effect be explicated on the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Sunday after Pentecoſt, where the Doctor of the Law <hi>tempting</hi> our Saviour, <hi>asked him,</hi> &amp;c. ſo here needs no more to be ſaid of it, then that it was an impertinent
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:204830:205"/> demand <hi>to ask a ſign</hi> of his Deity, after ſuch a Miracle as this.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. Here he ſhews them he knew their <hi>mindes,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding them in what they <hi>thought,</hi> although they <hi>ſpake</hi> it not, with the applying this <hi>Simile</hi> unto them that follows: which is as clear, as that Civil Wars deſtroy a Kingdom, and Faction in particular Families ruines both parties of the Faction, for that is underſtood by <hi>houſe upon houſe,</hi> family againſt family.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. For <hi>if I</hi> undertake to <hi>caſt out a devil,</hi> in the devils name or power (and ſo by your conſequence am my ſelf a devil) do you not ſee, it were to make a faction againſt the devil, who had Seated himſelf there, from whence <hi>I caſt him out;</hi> and ſo I ſhould rather make a new, then end the old ſtrife; therefore to end the matter <hi>I muſt</hi> uſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other power.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. By the former Verſe he had ſhewed them, his power was from another ſource, then from <hi>the devil,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently if they will yet hold that Doctrine, and ſay that one Devil is caſt out by another, he leaves them as men ſo deſperate, that are paſt all cure of reaſon; and ſo to be left unto <hi>the guide</hi> of that Devil, who had ſo ſtrangely blinded them. Thus the cloſe of this Verſe argues he concluded of them, whom he found ſo maliciouſly, ſo perverſly obſtinate in an Error: Or if we take it literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he <hi>caſting out devils</hi> in the devils name, if <hi>their children</hi> would undertake to caſt out the devil in another name (ſince he that was God, knew they did it not in Gods Name) he leaves them to be <hi>guided</hi> by <hi>their children,</hi> that is, he calls them fools, who would have <hi>children</hi> for <hi>their guides,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>children</hi> of Infidelity, for ſuch were all theirs.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. By <hi>the finger of God,</hi> he in this place underſtands the Spirit or power of God: for ſo S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks, relating the ſame ſtory, <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 28. by <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> he means the grace which doth here begin to reign, and ſhall perfectly rule in Glory, when it hath brought
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:204830:206"/> thoſe to Heaven, whom it governed upon Earth. And certainly Grace deſerves the Title of the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> when it is manifeſtly made appear to be deſtructive to the Kingdom of the Devil, as by overcoming Sin it is, and as here actually it was, by <hi>caſting out the devil</hi> from that place where he had ſeated himſelf; for though God be the principal, yet Grace is the inſtrumental agent in all Sanctity, and works that are above Nature.</p>
                           <p n="21">21, 22. Theſe two Verſes argue from Similitude, very ſtrongly, and yet ſo clearly, that they need no other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, then their own words literally underſtood: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we note, the Devil was meant by the <hi>ſtrong man,</hi> his <hi>Court</hi> was this World, all wholly in his poſſeſſion by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that as fully as a fortified Town is in that Governors hands, againſt whom none dares lay a Siege, but <hi>leave all in peace</hi> in and about the Town: not that the children of <hi>Adam</hi> were <hi>in peace</hi> by being the Devils Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, but that no power was ſuch as durſt undertake to force them out of Captivity; until that happened which Chriſt aymed at, namely, that God <hi>came,</hi> who alone is able to lead <hi>Captivity captive,</hi> to overthrow the Devil and all his works.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. By this Verſe our Saviour told the Phariſees, they were his enemies, becauſe they took the Devils part <hi>againſt him,</hi> or which was all one, becauſe they did not take his part againſt the Devil; for as in a Town beſieged, all that will not (if call'd upon) fight to keep out the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy ſcaling the Walls, are held as much friends to the Enemy, as if they did actually fight for them: ſo they, now that Chriſt came to take this City of the World (theſe Phariſees) who would not, being called upon by him, fight for him, were eſteemed as if they did actually fight <hi>againſt him,</hi> ſince (as God) he was their lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and might command them to fight for him, by believing in him, as one that had power to quell the Devil.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. By the <hi>unclean Spirit,</hi> is here meant the Devil; ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:204830:206"/> called, becauſe he is not onely defiled by the malice of his own rebellious Sin, but is like a Sow, ever wallowing in the mire of all ſinful actions, as if his whole delight were to rowl in the filthy ſoul ſink of ſin: Chriſt here alludes to the former caſting out this <hi>unclean</hi> Spirit from the Jews, when God choſe that ſtiff necked people to be his Favorites above all the Nations of the earth: and in the perſons of his holy Patriarchs and Prophets, declared he had caſt the Devil out of all the Jews, who departing from them, wandereth up and down among the Gentiles, not unfitly called <hi>places without water,</hi> firſt as to God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording no drop of penitential Tears to expiate their ſins; next as to the Devil, being people he could not reſt in, becauſe he had not content in the eaſie conqueſt he made of them, who were not worthy to be eſteemed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites of God: And therefore the Devil out of pride eſteemed them even unworthy to be his accurſed lacqueys, and ſo could not reſt in ſuch a conqueſt, but returned again to that <hi>earth,</hi> which had at leaſt ſome wholeſome <hi>water</hi> to compact it into a body of people worthy to be called a Nation, which the Gentiles were unworthy of, while God, angry with the Jews, ſaid by the mouth of <hi>David, I will provoke them in a people, which is no Nation,</hi> meaning the Gentiles, that deſtroyed <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> The Devil therefore caſt out of the Jews into the Gentiles, when God made the Jews his choſen people, ſayes with himſelf, he will <hi>return again into his houſe whence he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted;</hi> for indeed he was maſter of all mens Souls, till God ſnatched the Jews out of his hands.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. <hi>The beſome</hi> that had <hi>ſwept</hi> this houſe, was the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which did indeed purifie the houſe of clay, the body of the Jews, but brought no Grace into their Souls: So hither the Devil returns again, when he ſet all thoſe people a murmuring in their way from <hi>Egypt</hi> to the land of Promiſe.</p>
                           <p n="26">26, 27. And remembring he was before <hi>caſt out,</hi> when he had <hi>taken</hi> but ſingle poſſeſſion, he now comes armed in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:204830:207"/> with many guurds, brings <hi>ſeven devils</hi> more along with him, that is to ſay, all the devils in Hell, or an indefinite number meant by this definite of <hi>ſeven,</hi> for ſo the malice of the Jews imports, when it grew more inraged againſt the Son of God, then all the devils of Hell alone could have expreſſed, had not the more helliſh Jew concurred to encreaſe the ſame. Bleſſed God! how truly doth this Verſe cloſe, ſaying, Theſe devils <hi>dwell there;</hi> ſince we are told the refractory Jew ſhall never be diſpoſſeſſed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely of this devil, till the day of Judgement, when Jew and Gentile ſhall both make up one Church of Chriſt, though but for a little time, yet ſufficient to verifie the Oracle of Truth, <hi>There ſhall be one ſold, and one ſhepherd.</hi> And thus literally we may expound theſe three Verſes: myſtically the receſs and acceſs of this foul Fiend is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, when Baptiſmal Grace firſt caſt a ſingle devil out of our Souls, guilty onely of ſingle Original ſin, and he by our reiterated actual ſins, returns again with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed numbers, his <hi>ſevenſold</hi> Fiends, the ſeven deadly Sins, or ſome ſuch graceleſs rabble, who <hi>made the laſt of this man worſe then the firſt.</hi> God ſend he dwell not in us till the Day of our private Doom, as certainly he will, unleſs we caſt the waters of Contrition on him, to quench the fire of his Malice both againſt God and us; and ſo ſmoak him out of his Manſion houſe, by making it a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the God he hates, when it is perfumed with the incenſe of Devotion, and adorned with all varieties of Vertues.</p>
                           <p n="28">28, 29. It ſeems there was a huge energy in Chriſt his delivering himſelf upon this ſubject, when a pious woman raviſht, as it were, with admiration of his Sanctity and ſolidity of diſcourſe, <hi>cryed out,</hi> praiſing and magnifying not onely him, but even <hi>the womb that bare him,</hi> and <hi>the paps that gave him ſuck,</hi> not without ſpecial Providence of God, ordaining her ſpeech to the praiſe of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not the Father, to ſhew he had no Father, as he was man.</p>

                              <pb n="53" facs="tcp:204830:207"/>30. This did not deny, but it was indeed a great <hi>bleſſing</hi> for the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to have had her Saviour in her wombe, but yet it tels us, both ſhe and others are <hi>more bleſſed</hi> to have him in their Souls; and ſo to make their Soules Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the <hi>Words</hi>-Spirit, or of Spirituall Words, is to be much more honourable then to have the <hi>word-fleſh</hi> in their bodily wombe, or to be the Spirituall Parent of Chriſt, (bringing forth the fruit of his Goſpell) then the corporall (bringing forth his fleſh and bloud;) ſo the <hi>word of</hi> God is valued above the <hi>body of Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Spirit</hi> is better then his <hi>Fleſh.</hi> And the reaſon is, that to bee Mother of God was a grace <hi>gratis</hi> given, not making grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but to <hi>heare,</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall grace rendring one acceptable: againe, to be Gods Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not ſuffice to ſave her; but to <hi>heare</hi> and <hi>keep Gods word</hi> doeth: the one proper to her, the other common to all Chriſtians,</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:204830:212"/> fruitfull was the child of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſo barren that of the letter; ſo abundant the child of <hi>grace,</hi> ſo ſparing that of <hi>fleſh and bloud;</hi> the reaſon was, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> being but a man of <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> was the firſt-born of the Synagogue, but Chriſt who was both God and Man, was the firſt-born of the Church: not that therefore he was not the head and founder thereof, but that in the order of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, the firſt thought was to ſerve himſelfe of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or people regulated in the old Law by a Synagogue, in the new, by a Church, and ſo by priority of nature, (as the Schoolemen ſpeake,) the <hi>Jdaea's</hi> of Synagogue, and Church were firſt in Gods decree, though there were no priority of time, wherein the Synagogue was exiſtent before <hi>Moſes</hi> the firſt-borne thereof; nor of the Church before Chriſt, the firſt-borne of her: So here we ſee, it is not inconſiſtent, that Chriſt be both the Father and the childe of the Church, the childe, as the firſt borne of it in the ſight of God, the Father, as the firſt erector of it in the ſight of man.</p>

And from hence floweth the genuine ſence of this next verſe, wherein the Apoſtle doth not onely meane, that we Chriſtians are <hi>Brothers</hi> to each other, but that we have yet an honour farre tranſcending this, namely to be even the Brethren of Chriſt Jeſus, ſo that he is a <hi>child,</hi> as as well as we are the children of <hi>promiſe,</hi> and conſequently he and we are <hi>brethren,</hi> being borne both of one <hi>promiſing</hi> parent Almighty God, out of the barren wombe of <hi>Sara,</hi> he only having this prerogative to be the firſt-borne of <hi>Sara,</hi> and ſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> heire, but we (as being his brethren,) by vertue of the ſame promiſe, are his coheires.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. This verſe alludes to what we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. v. 8. of the jeſting or playing of <hi>Jſmael</hi> ſo familiarly with <hi>Jſaac</hi> at the banquet which <hi>Abraham</hi> made, when <hi>Iſaac</hi> the younger brother was weaned; that <hi>Sara</hi> knowing it was her Sonne <hi>Jſaac,</hi> who muſt be heir to his Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him not onely of the boldneſſe of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and of his ſawcy familiarity with <hi>Jſaac,</hi> (which was a figure of the

St. <hi>John</hi> according to his wonted cuſtom omits what St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath more in relation of this ſtory, namely that Chriſt, <hi>after he had lifted up his eyes and ſaw a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people, ſaid, I have compaſſion on this people,</hi> becauſe he remembred what <hi>David</hi> had foretold, was his charge, Pſalm 9. verſe 14. <hi>The poor man is left unto Thee, and thou wilt be a help to the fatherleſs:</hi> O! how many eyes do we lift up to the Potentates of this world? how few do we caſt down upon the poor? but <hi>Ieſus</hi> remembers his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to us, how negligent ſoever we are of our duty to him; he looks upon the poor with eyes of mercy, of pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of compaſſion, and therefore ſayes immediately to <hi>Philip, whence ſhall we buy bread, that theſe may eat?</hi> where we are to obſerve the onely efficacious way to relieve the poor is to conſult their exigencies with the pitiful, as it ſeems St. <hi>Philip</hi> was, of whom for that ſpecial reaſon Chriſt asks this queſtion, rather then of the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; again we muſt note, Chriſt was ſollicitous to <hi>buy</hi> corporal <hi>bread</hi> for thoſe that out of zeal had followed him to feed upon the ſpiritual Doctrine, or <hi>bread</hi> of his ſacred Word.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Chriſt is here ſaid to <hi>tempt</hi> or try <hi>Philip,</hi> becauſe it is very fit men ſhould firſt ſee their wants can be ſupplied by none, but God himſelf; and this appeared by <hi>Philip</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So thus Chriſt <hi>tempted</hi> man to ſhew himſelf God, by doing that which was above mans power to effect, or to hope for indeed;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:204830:216"/> again he <hi>tempted</hi> an Apoſtle to declare thoſe are the men who by office are to have care of all the poor throughout the world, for their recommending mouthes muſt be (when all is done) the poor mens purſes.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. But ſee <hi>Philips</hi> anſwer to this Temptation: he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told what ſlender ſtore of money they had in all their company, but <hi>two hundred pence,</hi> and the bread which that could buy, would not be for each mouth there one morſel: ſo he deſpaired of their being fed upon that ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtock of money; but in this account the Apoſtle was out, the purſe of providence was full, though theirs of maintenance were empty; and the more <hi>Philip</hi> proceeds like man, the more we ſee Chriſt appears like God.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. 9. See how St. <hi>Andrew</hi> (neerer allyed to Faith by his brother <hi>Peter</hi>) renowned for that vertue more then <hi>Philip,</hi> was, findes out a <hi>boy with five loaves and two fiſhes</hi> at leaſt; but checks himſelf for the fondneſs of his firſt flaſh of hope, that this could be enough, by adding, <hi>what is this amongſt ſo many?</hi> yet ſtill divine providence guids the proceſs of this humane action, for by how much the more they all deſpair, by ſo much the miracle is ſtill the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and that Chriſt had no ambition in this action is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe he rather choſe to let creatures ſhare with him in contributing ſomthing at leaſt to his miracle, then that he would Creatour-like, do it all himſelf out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; ſo for this reaſon he permits thoſe inconſiderable numbers of <hi>fiſhes</hi> and of <hi>loaves,</hi> to enter into the reliefe of that prodigious multitude, he ſatisfied therewith.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. This verſe is onely narrative, that the <hi>five thouſand</hi> were by Chriſt his command placed moſt probably as St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us the ſtory in <hi>companies,</hi> according to the cuſtom at great dinners, men by men, and women apart with their children in their laps, both for modeſty ſake, and for the more eaſie diſtribution of each perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. Hence we learn while, <hi>Jeſus gives thanks,</hi> the laudable cuſtome of ſaying grace before and after meales, to ſhew
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:204830:216"/> all our ſuſtenance, is Gods ſpeciall bleſſing upon us; but we are here to note Saint <hi>Matth. ca.</hi> 14. Sayes in this ſtory, Chriſt looking up to Heaven <hi>Bleſſed, brake, and gave the Loaves to his Diſciples,</hi> which they afterwards diſtributed to the people ſet round about on the ground: the like ſaith St. <hi>Mark cap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 41. <hi>he bleſſed and break the bread:</hi> ſo hath St. <hi>Luke cap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 36. all which is alledged to ſhew, how ill the hereticks decline the uſual cuſtom of Chriſt, who ever <hi>bleſſed bread,</hi> and leſt they ſhould be convinced, that this <hi>bleſſing</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> at any time was previous to his conſecrating of it, into his bleſſed body, they always tranſlate <hi>Bleſſing</hi> for <hi>Thanksgiving;</hi> whereas to bleſs God, is indeed a thanksgiving to him, for the bleſſings we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him; but yet <hi>bleſſing bread</hi> and meat is another thing, which Hereticks will never yield unto, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons above. It remains here to reconcile St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> upon this place, the former ſaying, <hi>Mat. c.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Chriſt gave the bread and fiſhes to his diſciples</hi> to diſtribute; The latter, <hi>Ioh. c.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 11. that he gave it to the people himſelf, whereas both being verifiable in a right ſenſe, there can be no contradiction, for what the Diſciples <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed</hi> to the people, Chriſt <hi>gave them,</hi> by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Diſciples hands; and indeed it is more likely the Diſciples did <hi>diſtribute</hi> the gift, becauſe thus, it was ſooner diſtributed by many hands to ſo many people. We will not ſtand here to diſcuſs, how this <hi>bread</hi> was multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, whether by creating new corn, or extending that little to infinite parts, certain it is which way ſoever we grant it done, the <hi>bread</hi> given was moſt ſubſtantial, and gave as wholeſom nouriſhment, as it did abundant ſatura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the hungry ſtomacks that did eat it; for <hi>the works of God are perfect,</hi> and morally hence we learn, what we give to the poor, doth increaſe (not any way diminiſh) our wealth, ſince after all men were full, there remained of <hi>five loaves twelve baskets</hi> of ſurplus more then all could eat.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. 13. Theſe two Verſes afford us this Doctrine, that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:204830:217"/> the poor man is the richeſt rewarder of any curteſie in the world: lo here, how <hi>twelve baskets</hi> of gratitude are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for <hi>five</hi> little <hi>loaves of bread</hi> onely. So this <hi>boy</hi> that had given little, received much, as a teſtimony that God never asks us for any thing, that himſelf hath need of it, but becauſe he knows we have huge neceſſity of his infinite Bleſſings, for the trifles he asks at our hands, with no other end, then to put them out for our emolument, a hundred fold over and over, above what that is worth, we give him; nor is it void of myſtery, that being there were <hi>twelve Apoſtles,</hi> each ſhould receive his multiplyed ſhare in the diſtribution he made, to ſhew, that no Miniſter of God can in vain labour in his cauſe, ſince even <hi>Iudas</hi> whom Chriſt knew then to be hollow-hearted, was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from the fruit of his labours too, becauſe they fructifie from their root, Almighty God, not from the branch they grow upon.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. By <hi>the Prophet</hi> they mean the Meſſias, of whom they expected <hi>wonders,</hi> and ſeeing <hi>theſe,</hi> they concluded <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>he.</hi> See the difference between theſe devout people and the proud <hi>Phariſees;</hi> theſe ask <hi>ſignes</hi> upon ſignes, and when they ſee more, then they can in reaſon ask for, yet they believe none at all to be the work of God; for indeed the <hi>ſigns</hi> which they demanded were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities, meer Caſtles in the air; but here are people, without asking can obſerve <hi>a ſigne</hi> given of Chriſts omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, beſtowed not in vain, but in a caſe of neceſſity upon the poor, and ſeeing but this one <hi>ſigne,</hi> they reſt ſatisfied, and went away praiſing God for the wonderful works of his ſacred Son, our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. This <hi>intention</hi> which Jeſus ſaw in theſe people of <hi>ſeizing on him to make him king,</hi> he did alſo ſee, was out of a Judaical Intereſt, that he might make them rich and great, for they ſerved God in their way with regard to humane and temporal bleſſings, and as much for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as for his own diſdain of humane honours, <hi>he fled</hi> from theſe promotions, that is, he ſlipt aſide from the people,

AS the Expoſitours of the Holy Text do interpret this, feeding many thouſand people in the deſert Mountain with five loaves of Bread and two Fiſhes onely, to be a myſtery of the Bleſſed Sacrament, ſo the Holy Church having carried us now up to the high Mountain of corporal abſtinence, which we have been climbing theſe three weeks together, following her Preachers daily, as theſe people did our Saviour, gives us this preſent Goſpel as a ſpiritual Banquet to refreſh us after a tedious journey; to ſhew us that the end of our corporal Faſt, is to make us worthy of a ſpiritual Feaſt, which is this day beſtowed upon us in this myſtery of the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

And as by this we ſee a <hi>joyful Communion</hi> is an accompliſhment of our Lenten Faſt; ſo before that Communion we are fitly taught to premiſe ſuch a Prayer, as may firſt ſtrike into us an act of Contrition, and then compleat our <hi>Ioy.</hi>

God grant, that all may ſee it, when 'tis made appear out of the Prayer
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:204830:219"/> above: which I confeſs was to me as hard, as if I had been forc't to pick a lock, whereof the proper key was loſt: and truly where to finde a mention of the Paſſion in a proper term, in all this Prayer I know not; but yet this help remains, a common key will do as well, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per keys are miſſing. Take therefore the <hi>propitious look</hi> of God upon us which to day we beg, and then believe the door is open to our Saviours Paſſion; for what is that? but a <hi>propitiation</hi> for our ſins? which we implore, when <hi>we beſeech Almighty God</hi> to look <hi>propitiouſly upon his Family;</hi> and though we uſe this phraſe at other times, as well as now, yet that forbids not a common key to open a private door, nay rather this is indeed the particular key unto the Paſſion, and made common upon all other occaſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſacred Sea flows over all the other works, and mercies of Almighty God, gives force and value to all our actions, and ſo is here properly applyed, however it hath become a common ſtile in all our Prayers. Now by this key we ſhall open all the doors of this days Epiſtle and Goſpel, for why is <hi>Chriſt his blood</hi> a more powerful Sacrifice then that of <hi>Oxen, Goats,</hi> and <hi>Heyfers</hi> in the old Law, as this Epiſtle tells us? but becauſe <hi>theirs</hi> availed onely to a <hi>nominal</hi> purity, <hi>This</hi> to a <hi>real propitiation</hi> for all our ſins, <hi>that</hi> onely leads us into the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of the Arke, <hi>this</hi> into the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of glory: to conclude, this <hi>propitious look</hi> we begge to day unlocks the Cabinet of the Goſpel alſo, and leads us (after a long conteſt between Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and the Jewes, whether <hi>he</hi> or <hi>they were devils,</hi> whether <hi>he</hi> or <hi>Abraham</hi> were the <hi>greater</hi> perſon,) unto the very firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into his Sacred Paſſion; where we ſhould finde them <hi>ſtoning him</hi> to death, but that he miraculouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves himſelfe for a more ignominious Sacrifice upon the Altar of the holy Croſſe; for whileſt Jeſus thus expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with the Jewes, certainly he did looke <hi>propitiouſly</hi> upon the Gentiles, in whoſe behalfe hee ſo much exaſperated the Jewes, as they menaced his death, And this may ſuffice to bring our new floud in.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:204830:224"/> God;</hi> and therefore they <hi>heard it not,</hi> becauſe they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the inſpiration of the evil, and not of the good <hi>Spirit:</hi> Now that he meant this as to them ill (at that time) inſpired, not ill created, or naturally made ill, it is evident, for diverſe of them were afterwards by his death, and by his Apoſtles preaching, converted and doubtleſs ſaved too; whence it follows, that as they natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally were not made ſo bad, as no good could come of them, ſo they were by ſupernatural (and not by natural) means made the good people, which afterwards they became; and thus thoſe once good, become bad again, when leaving the inſpiration of the good <hi>Spirit,</hi> they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the dictamens of the bad one.</p>

Many expound this Place diverſly; ſome will have <hi>the day of Chriſt</hi> (which <hi>Abraham did long for,</hi> and <hi>exulted to behold</hi>) to be the time of the eternal generation of the Word of God; others, the day of his Living upon Earth; others, the inſtant of the Incarnation of God in his Mothers Womb; others, the Day of his Paſſion, which wrought all mankindes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and all theſe very well. And they differ as much in expounding the Time, when <hi>Abraham</hi> injoyed <hi>this deſire</hi> by actually <hi>ſeeing this day;</hi> ſome affirming that by Faith he ſee <hi>this day,</hi> when he obeyed God, in Sacrificing his Son, which was a Figure of Chriſt his being to dye for our Sins; others, that <hi>he ſee</hi> it by Revelation, as Prophets do things to come; others, that he knew it, and <hi>ſee</hi> it, when <hi>Simeon</hi> came to <hi>Limbus,</hi> and told <hi>Abraham</hi> he had held Jeſus in his hands; as alſo when <hi>Zachary,</hi> St. <hi>Anne</hi> the Bleſſed Virgins Mother, and St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt told him, they had ſeen him, and likewiſe by the Angels of God telling him thereof, as the like Angels do tell Souls in Purgatory, what doth daily comfort them; but the beſt way of all is, that God for a reward of his Obedience, gave him the happineſs, both by Revelation and Elevation of his Souls Faculties to ſee Chriſt Born, as the Saints in Heaven. Now ſee all we do (if yet this may not be done as ſome conceive) by the very natural Faculty of a Soul, able of her ſelf to know all things naturally, as ſoon as ſhe is out of

This then was <hi>Abrahams</hi> Caſe, though if this were not, the Text doth not deny, all the reſt that ſee the day of Chriſt with <hi>Abraham,</hi> did <hi>exult</hi> thereat with him; but here it was enough to the purpoſe, that Chriſt told them, how careleſs ſoever they were of the honour, yet their Father <hi>Abraham rejoyced</hi> at it.</p>

                           <p n="58">58. And by this Anſwer of Chriſt, it is evident he ſpake of knowing <hi>Abraham,</hi> not as man (for ſo he was <hi>Abrahams</hi> Junior) but as God, who (as ſuch) created <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and all the world beſides, and therefore he doth

THe Apoſtle had in the foregoing verſes of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exhorted to <hi>humility</hi> in ſuperiority; and now in this verſe he takes for a rule of our <hi>humility that of Chriſt,</hi> who (though God) diſdained not to fall below the repute of man, and called himſelfe even a <hi>worme,</hi> and <hi>not a man,</hi> ſo low he had ſtooped for our inſtruction and example: And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by this expreſſion doth not onely wiſh us to thinke <hi>humbly</hi> of our ſelves, but even to feele by a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call humiliation, the ſame ſubjection within us, which Chriſt felt, when he became the <hi>ſcorne of men,</hi> and the <hi>out-caſt</hi> (or <hi>offals) of the people:</hi> This is the genuine ſenſe of the Apoſtle, though even to <hi>thinke</hi> (to reflect on <hi>Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi>) and by reflecting thereon to <hi>humble our ſelves,</hi> is not an ill expoſition of this place neither; and thereby to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelves, that as <hi>Chriſt his humility</hi> was the cauſe of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:204830:230"/> his exaltation, ſo will our <hi>humility</hi> prove to us, if we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it for our Saviours ſake.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. But to imprint this Doctrine deeper in us, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle amplifies, how farre Chriſt did debaſe himſelfe for our example, ſaying, that though <hi>he were in the forme of God</hi> &amp;c. Where we are to note, this word <hi>forme</hi> is here taken perverſely by the Arrians, when they thence infer, Chriſt was not really and truly God, but had onely a ſhape or <hi>forme divine,</hi> better then other men ever had; yet this is a groſſe corruption of the Text; for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meanes here Phyſicall, not Artificiall, naturall and not fictitious <hi>forme,</hi> ſuch <hi>forme</hi> as gives being to the thing in which it is; as the <hi>forme</hi> of wood gives an eſſentiall diſtinct being to wood, differing from all other ſubſtances that are not wood; and ſo in this place the Apoſtle ſayes, Chriſt <hi>being in the forme of God,</hi> (being really <hi>God</hi> himſelfe) who neither is nor can be multiplyed into many Gods, by <hi>the forme of God</hi> being communicated to many perſons, as the <hi>forme</hi> of man is multiplyed into many men, though all thoſe men have but one <hi>forme</hi> ſpecificall, one humane <hi>forme.</hi> This ſhewes, the nature or <hi>forme of God</hi> is infinitely more perfect, and more ſimple, then any other nature can be, which may be nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically multiplyed, though ſpecifically it ſtill remaine one, as humane nature is, when many men contract it, but the divine nature is not ſo multiplyed, though contracted by three diſtinct perſons: for we cannot ſay, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gods, though it is moſt true, there are many men: ſo the Apoſtle here ſpeaks literally, and rigorouſly of <hi>the form</hi> (of the nature divine) and ſayes, Chriſt, being coequall <hi>God</hi> with his Father (in regard of his divine nature) <hi>held it not robberie</hi> to ſay <hi>he was equal to God,</hi> held it no prejudice to his Father to ſay, he was truly one and the ſame God with him.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:204830:231"/> every childe of <hi>Adam</hi> received a contagion, or corruption from him, and yet humane nature in the line of a creature to God was not corrupted, ſo as to be a leſs perfect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then it was before, for that had been to corrupt the Eſſence, not the Perſons of mankinde; whereas ſin onely corrupted his State, and not his Eſſence, the Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Humane Nature, and not the Nature of man it ſelf: for if ſo, Chriſt being man made of that Humane Nature muſt have been corrupted (in that nature at leaſt) which yet he was not. By the <hi>Similitude of man</hi> in this verſe, we are to underſtand literally the external ſhape of man, not the accidental or phantaſtical (as the Hereticks ſaid) but the ſubſtantial and real ſhape: though St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> takes it here as for the predicament of habit, which conſiſts in Garments or Clothing, and likens Chriſts Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to be as a Garment covering his Divinity, or as Iron is made fiery, or as Gold is made a Statue; and even in that Sence the thing is as true, as it is ingeniouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> By being <hi>made as man</hi> is not to ſay onely like man, and not to be truly ſuch, but <hi>like</hi> here ſignifies to be <hi>ſo like</hi> as it is the <hi>very ſame;</hi> as if a Statue ſhould from a dead Stone be made move, as a man moveth, eat, as a man eateth, ſpeak, as a man ſpeaketh; why ſtill by every one of theſe gradations the Statue becomes more like a man then it was before, and when at laſt it had all the Faculties of a man, it became as man indeed, that is to ſay, not onely like, but really and truly man: In this Sence our Saviour was ſaid to be as man, as if we ſaid, though he were truly God, yet he did not appear to be ſo, but appeared onely to be <hi>as man,</hi> which truly he was, as well as he was God.</p>

This <hi>humility</hi> was not an Act of God the Son to God the Father, for ſo there is no commanding Power in the one over the other, but of his Humanity, both to his own Divine Perſon, and to his heavenly Father too; by dying <hi>on the Croſs</hi> in vertue of this <hi>command,</hi> Chriſt did <hi>humble himſelf</hi> as low as could be, in regard no death was

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:204830:234"/> living, all proviſions for Sacrifices were made ready, Lambs, Goats, Oxen, Pigeons, Turtles, and the like; and therefore Chriſt was pleaſed to paſs this way (through the Golden gate) into Jeruſalem, to ſhew, he was <hi>the lamb of God,</hi> who came to be ſacrificed for the ſins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that it was his ſacred Perſon, whom the Paſchal Lamb did prefigure: As alſo for this cauſe he came from <hi>Bethania,</hi> when he had a little before raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from his grave, and paſſed now triumphantly through the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Joſaphat,</hi> into the earthly Jeruſalem; to declare that in the ſame valley he was to come much more trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly, as Judge over all the dead, who ſhould at the latter day be raiſed, and (carrying the Bleſſed onely with him into the heavenly City of Jeruſalem) would leave the wicked to eternal confuſion; as thoſe (who now conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his death after this Triumph) were to be left over to utter deſtruction, both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                           <p n="4">4. 5. As by theſe two following verſes doth appeare, it was neceſſary that he ſhould take this title to verifie all the predictions, that were of him <hi>by the Prophets,</hi> as namely this of his Triumph into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was by the Prophet <hi>Iſaias,</hi> Chap. 62. v. 11. though others conceive this place is but cited as coincident with that of <hi>Zacharie,</hi> Chap. 9. v. 9. to the ſame purpoſe; and ſo <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> explicates this Text upon that of <hi>Zacharie;</hi> ſee him for more of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in that Tome; by <hi>the Yoke</hi> is here underſtood, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then laid upon the <hi>Aſſes</hi> back, not that <hi>Aſſes</hi> did then uſe to draw with <hi>Yokes</hi> upon their necks, as Oxen doe.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. This Verſe onely ſhews the promptitude wherewith <hi>the Diſciples</hi> obeyed our Lords <hi>commands,</hi> as no way doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to finde what he bad them ſeek, or to have been bid to bring what they ſhould not finde: and by this we are

Now as there can be no tidings of any greater joy unto us (who even naturally deſire eternall life) then for holy Church to tel us, it is this day beſtowed upon us by Chriſt his <hi>riſing</hi> from his grave, and by his raiſing us to everlaſting life from the eternal death of deadly ſame, which before had ſwallowed up all mankinde; ſo we ought to rejoyce to day, as a dead man would to find himſelfe revived, and brought from the brink of eternal damnation, unto a promiſe of eternal life and bliſſe.

                           <p n="7">7. BY <hi>the old leaven,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meanes that notorious kinde of Fornication, which was practized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> worſe then any among Gentiles, as in the firſt verſe of this Chapter, the Apoſtle ſayes of it in termes, namely to lye with their Mother in Law, or Fathers wife, which, it ſeemes, ſome one or more among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did ſo openly practiſe, that they even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the fact, or at leaſt would not be reclaimed from it; whence the Apoſtle orders them to be excommunicated and given, (as he ſaith v. 5.) <hi>corporally over to Satan,</hi> that ſo by this puniſhment their Soules may be reclaimed from that filthy ſinne and ſaved. Wherefore it is of this noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vice by name, (and of all other whatſoever ſort of ſinnes) the Apoſtle ſpeakes here under the name of <hi>leaven,</hi> which he would have the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to <hi>purge,</hi> (to caſt out
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:204830:239"/> from amongſt them) for he had told them in the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Verſe before, how the <hi>leaſt of Leaven would ſpoil a whole Batch of bread,</hi> giving it a diſreliſhing taſte; and for this cauſe it was commanded in the old Law, that when the Paſcal Lamb was killed, it ſhould be eaten with bread purer and ſweeter then ordinary, ſuch as was made without any <hi>leaven</hi> in it at all, to give it the leaſt diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to the taſte: and this Bread was by a ſpecial and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name called <hi>Azymes,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>unleavened bread;</hi> and to this the Apoſtle alludes, when he exhorts the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> to <hi>purge</hi> out of their conſciences all ſin whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as he inſinuated, when he wiſhed them to caſt out of their ſociety (by excommunication) any one that ſhould be ſcandalous in his life, as it ſeems, this, both Adulterer and Fornicator was, that kept his Mother in Law for his Concubine, a ſin the very Gentiles did abominate. The literal Sence therefore of the Verſe is exhorting the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> (and in them all us Chriſtians) that ſince our <hi>Paſcal Lamb Chriſt Jeſus is immolated</hi> (ſacrificed upon the Altar of the Croſs for the ſins of the people) they (and we alſo) ſhould remember, as the Legal Paſche was to be eaten with pure and unleavened bread, ſo the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Paſche <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> was at this Feaſt of Eaſter to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with pure conſciences, clean Souls, ſuch as by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Confeſſion, and Satisfaction had been <hi>purged</hi> from <hi>the old leaven</hi> of ſin, and more, made a Spiritual <hi>Azyme</hi> or unleavened bread, <hi>fit</hi> to be eaten with this Paſcal Lamb, this Bleſſed Sacrament, that was now by ſpecial command of Holy Church to be received, with a Chriſtian Piety exceeding in all degrees that of the Ceremonial Law, upon the onely Umbratil or Figurative Exhibition, of this real Subſtance and Truth, Beſides it is worthy our remark in this place, that all the Neophytes of the Primitive Church were brought in White Garments on the firſt Saturday af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eaſter to be Baptized, and at the putting off their White Garments were to receive an <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> from the Biſhop, which was to hang about their necks, down upon
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:204830:239"/> their Breaſts, in Teſtimony of an inward Purity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience put upon their Souls at the caſting off their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Garments, which were onely Figures of this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Candor of Conſcience: to this alſo alludes the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome put upon the heads of thoſe that are Baptized, and the Candle given into their hands, repreſenting the Light of Grace to be their guides to Heaven, whoſe Souls are pure and clean from ſin: Note, that what we now call <hi>Paſche</hi> was originally called the <hi>Paſsover,</hi> becauſe it was a legal Lamb yearly commanded to be killed and eaten in memory of their preſervations, who had their Poſts and Threſholds of their Doors, ſprinkled with the Blood of a Lamb, as we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. v. 11. for a mark to ſhew the Angel whoſe houſes he was <hi>to paſs</hi> by, or <hi>over,</hi> without killing the Firſt-born therein, whereas elſe he was to ſpare none that had not the Blood of a Lamb upon their doors: ſo by Allegory we now call Chriſt our Paſcal Lamb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Blood was ſhed to preſerve from the Angel of darkneſs his Ireful Sword, the Firſt-born of Grace, that is the Chriſtians, or the true Believers in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. And hence the Apoſtle in this next Verſe exhorts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (and in them all Chriſtians) to make a Solemn Feaſt of Joy all this Paſchal time, that is, all their life time (for the ſeven Days of this Feaſt ſignifie all the days of our life) and to feed now, not upon old Leaven, that is, (not upon priſtin Infidelity:) And leaſt hence it ſhould be thought, Faith alone were enough for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to be ſaved by, the Apoſtle addes, we muſt not onely believe right (which is to caſt off the <hi>old Leaven</hi> of Infidelity) but further we muſt do good Works, and ſo caſt off the <hi>Leaven of malice and wickedneſs,</hi> alſo by taking in their places <hi>the Azymes</hi> (the unleavened bread of good Works) of <hi>Sincerity</hi> in our Actions, of <hi>verity</hi> in our Words, as the Badges of upright Chriſtians, that neither we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble with God nor with our Neighbour, in thought, word, or deed; but as we have vowed in Holy Baptiſm, we ſhall make it good all the days of our life, that ſo we

For though before our Saviour ſuffered for our ſins, he did converſe with ſinners, yet now that he is riſen from his Grave, he hath not taken any ſinner with him from the dead, how then can living ſinners hope to keep him company? and how without him can we hope to live?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. O happy Chriſtians in our Riſing Chriſt! who hath deſtroyed Death, and given us a double Life by his once onely dying; a Life of Grace to that we had of Nature, ſo though we cannot hope to keep him company by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as to Nature, which propends to ſin, and ſo to death; yet we may hope by living as to Grace, which leads to Vertue, and ſo to everlaſting Life, to keep him company for all Eternity: yes, this may be our hope if with St. <hi>Paul</hi> each one of us can ſay, <hi>I live now, not I, but Chriſt he lives in me.</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. THat is, when Saturday night was <hi>paſt</hi> (for Saturday was <hi>the Sabbath</hi> of the Jews) then (and not till then) leſt they ſhould be ſaid to violate <hi>the Sabbath, they bought Spices to anoint Jeſus.</hi> Here is to be noted the Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Diligence to be uſed by Chriſtian Souls, to take hold of the firſt minute of time allowed for devotion, and not to loyter any inſtant thereof away, ſince theſe pious women watched purpoſely all night to lay hold of the firſt ſtroake of the clock, which ſtrook twelve, that then they might freely call up the Shop keepers to ſell them oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when the laſt minute of <hi>the Sabbath was paſt.</hi> Note, theſe three women, were <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> the ſiſter to <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Lazarus, Mary of James,</hi> that is, the Mother of James the leſſer, ſo called for diſtinction from the other <hi>Iames</hi> the greater, who was alſo an Apoſtle: and <hi>Salome,</hi> wife to <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> Mother to <hi>James</hi> the greater, and to <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, the favourite of Jeſus: and whether or no <hi>Salome</hi> be her Chriſtian name here or her ſurname, is not cleer by the Text; For ſhe may have been <hi>Mary Salome</hi> wife to <hi>Zebedeus</hi> above, which is not unſuitable to the common Tradition of the three <hi>Maries</hi> that viſited the Sepulcher of Chriſt, and to whom in recompence he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appeared: by this action we ſee the ancient cuſtom of Pilgrimage to Holy Places, and reverencing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, however thoſe who deny that to be lawful, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the Reliques of Chriſt, and others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was God: and it was beſides an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Jews to embalm dead bodies, to make them odoriferous and ſweet; ſo this was not done by them to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204830:241"/> Chriſt as God, for indeed they did not then firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Deity, but were paſſionate Lovers of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſon; and as they eſteemed him a man of Bleſſed Life, ſo to ſhew their devotion to him, they went as it were, to embalm his Body and his Tombe, which they revered as Reliques of man, not of God: and as this gives a literal avowment to Pilgrimages and worſhip of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, ſo it is a Tropical Example for all Chriſtians to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the oyntments of their Vertues and good Works about them, as ſhewing they deſire therewith to embalm the Memory of Chriſts Death and Paſſion; and thoſe who ſhall be diligent in this Art of Piety, may hope with the firſt to ſee Chriſt in Heaven, for the reward of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſo Religiouſly on the Grave of his Death and Paſſion in this life.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It ſeems they had been ſtayed in their journey to the Sepulchre, either in the buying their oyntments, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other accommodations for their holy purpoſe, that it was <hi>Sun-riſing</hi> ere they came to <hi>the Monument,</hi> how ever they were going thither from midnight to that time of the day, and had aſſuredly the merit of a more ſpeedy arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, though (by Divine providence) it was appointed, Chriſt ſhould be out of his Grave, ſooner then any the moſt faithful Soul could get thither, to ſee whether he was riſen (or not) according to his promiſe; if yet they were not retarded by the ſame Providence, for a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their want of Faith, that came with intent to finde him there, and as man to embalm him, whom as God they ought to have believed was <hi>riſen,</hi> and needed not thoſe pious expreſſions towards his humanity, which this Reſolution and Action in theſe holy Women did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Here again they betraied the weakneſs of their Faith, as if God could not remove all obſtacles in the way to his own Service; as it ſeems <hi>really</hi> he did by the hands of his holy Angels, who St. <hi>Matth. cap.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 3. ſayes, had <hi>rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:204830:242"/> did not by any his Corporal Touch, but by making an Earth-quake purpoſely to do it, and joyntly to ſhew the terrour all the Earth was in, for having covered the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: and by this we ſee the Power that Angels have over all Corporal Things, when they can (even by the Touch of their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or Powers) make the whole Earth to quake: not that there was need for the Angel to <hi>remove this ſtone,</hi> that Chriſt might riſe, for he did riſe before the Stone was gone, by the ſame Power wherewith he came out of his Mothers Wombe, without the leaſt violation of her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, but meerly that <hi>by the ſtones removal</hi> the coming <hi>Maries</hi> (and others to follow) might ſee Chriſt was riſen: and why may not Chriſts Body be as well all under the Little Wafer of the Conſecrated Hoſte, as it was able to paſs through the Virgins Wombe, a Childe, and through the Stone, a Man, without any Diviſion in either Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Bodies through which it paſſed? Note, though theſe <hi>Maries</hi> were ſolicitous who ſhould help them to <hi>role away the ſtone,</hi> yet they went on with their Holy Reſolutions, to ſhew us we are not to deſiſt from doing good, though we finde huge Difficulties in our way, but to proceed and put our truſt in God, that to thoſe who Love him, even every thing in Nature will co-operate towards the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Loves.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. This Verſe gives an excellent Proof of what was ſaid laſt; for ſee, they no ſooner <hi>look</hi> to have <hi>the ſtone removed,</hi> but they finde it done to their hands, by the Angel as above, though they knew not who did it; and therefore here is mention, this Stone <hi>was very Great,</hi> becauſe we ſhould not deſpair of overcoming any the greateſt Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the way of a willing Soul to ſerve Almighty God.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. See, they loſe no time to ask, or wonder how the <hi>ſtone</hi> was gone, their mindes were wholly bent on the end of their journey, and they minded not ſo much the rubs in the way, as to ſtop, and ſay, here we expected a rub, but go on courageouſly to the end, as placing their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:204830:242"/> in that, not in the <hi>mediums</hi> thereto, which they paſs over, as good Chriſtians ought to do, with a zeal, that carries them ſtill on unto the end of their Aims: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve they are again puniſhed for want of Faith, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt, and finding onely a <hi>young man</hi> (that is, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel) ſitting upon his Tombe, which was all open, and had no Body in it; And probably this Angel was <hi>Gabriel,</hi> whoſe name imports <hi>fortitude,</hi> and therefore he was the witneſs of this laſt Act of Gods Power, ſhewed in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Man, as he was the firſt that brought to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> tidings of the ſame Chriſt his Incarnation, when upon the news thereof ſhe did conceive: but this Angel appears for many other reſpects; to ſhew unto the <hi>Maries</hi> it was he, that had <hi>removed the ſtone</hi> out of their way (as our good Angels ever do all temptations out of ours) to ſhew, that as the Jews exteriorly kept the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, ſo Angels did wait upon it within; Laſtly to let the armed Jews ſee, the unarmed Servants of Chriſt were too hard for them, when he pleaſed to aſſiſt his naked Servants, againſt the moſt ſtrongly armed Men or Devils in Hell: But there is yet further myſtery in this Angels <hi>ſitting,</hi> when another Evangeliſt (St. <hi>Luke</hi>) ſays he was <hi>ſtanding,</hi> for that imports as much as <hi>ſitting</hi> too, in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Phraſe: ſo this Evangeliſt ſays, Cap 7. ver. 37. that <hi>Mary Magdalene ſtood</hi> behinde the feet of Jeſus, waſhing them with her Tears, and wiping them with her Hair, which yet imported, ſhe did either kneel or lye down; ſo <hi>ſtanding</hi> there imports ſhe was preſent when Chriſt ſat at the Table, and did as above: beſides, by the poſition of <hi>ſitting,</hi> is here ſignified the firm and fixed Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſtians ought to believe the myſtery of the <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi> and again by <hi>ſitting</hi> on the <hi>ſtone</hi> of his <hi>monument</hi> is myſtically told us Chriſts Faith was placed upon the <hi>ſtone</hi> of his Church, or of the head thereof; or that as <hi>ſtones</hi> are heavy and preſs hard upon us, ſo by this <hi>ſtone</hi> was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied how heavily death lyes upon all mankinde, and yet while the Angel <hi>ſets</hi> upon it, he declares that Chriſt

It is no wonder that they were <hi>aſtoniſhed</hi> to ſee this <hi>young man</hi> there, and to miſs the Body of our Saviour, which they ſought; for aſſuredly they either found there (or met) the ſouldiers running away all in a fright, ſince the Angel did appear even unto the ſouldiers to fright them: and the women not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other intention in the Angel then to do the like to all that came to this place (then delivered into the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Angels) they with reaſon fell alſo into a mighty fear, which yet was mixed with a kinde of hope, whileſt they did not run away as the ſouldiers, but rather ſtood in a middle ſtate between hope and fear, <hi>aſtoniſhed</hi> indeed, but not frighted at the ſight, wondered at it, but did not wander from it, nor can a good Spirit appear ſo affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but withal he brings a kinde of Comfort to all that ſee him, if they be Gods Servants.</p>

(as is the Paſchal Feaſt) and yet this is it we pray for to day; and not onely to <hi>retain this feaſt</hi> in our memories, but <hi>in our manners and our lives:</hi> ſure then the meaning is, we muſt <hi>retain</hi> thoſe <hi>good deſires,</hi> which we beſought God <hi>to proſecute in us</hi> in our laſt Sundays Prayer, and which, as by his <hi>preventing grace</hi> they were <hi>afforded us,</hi> ſo by his continued <hi>bounty</hi> we now beg ability to continue, or <hi>retain</hi> them in <hi>our manners</hi> and <hi>lives.</hi> Now albeit this makes the Prayer above to be, as it were, a recapitulation of the laſt Sundays Prayer (ſince the Octave Day is a cloſing up, one and the ſelf ſame Feaſt that began ſeven days before) yet we muſt finde a deeper ſence in this days Prayer, ſuch as petitioneth, we ſhould <hi>retain</hi> the Vertues, which did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the <hi>accompliſhment of the Paſchal Feaſt,</hi> as the good <hi>deſires</hi> to thoſe Vertues: and if we look back to what thoſe Vertues were, we ſhall finde them to be <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>verity,</hi> or rather in a word, perfect <hi>Sanctity,</hi> ſuch as might make the <hi>old Leaven</hi> in us of ſin, to be White Manchet of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if it were nothing for us to make yearly Memory of Chriſt his Death and Paſſion, and of his Reſurrection (for in theſe two Myſteries conſiſt the Paſchal Feaſt) unleſs our ſelves did remain ever dead unto ſin, and ever alive to God, by vertue of our reſurrection in his holy grace; aſſuredly this muſt be the ſence of our Prayer to day, for this is truly to <hi>retaine</hi> in <hi>our manners and lives</hi> the <hi>Feaſts of Paſche</hi> that are paſt, when we make our ſelves Paſchall Lambes, by the <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and <hi>Sanctity</hi> of <hi>our lives,</hi> and <hi>manners.</hi> For thus we ſhall firſt by our <hi>Faith overcome the world,</hi> and next by our good works give <hi>the teſtimony of Gods Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit being in us,</hi> which this dayes Epiſtle ſo much inſiſteth on, as the effect of our <hi>[Faith,]</hi> and of our <hi>[Victory]</hi> over the world by the ſame <hi>[Faith.]</hi> And to the Goſpell this Prayer is literall; whilſt it beggs we may <hi>retaine</hi> in us that <hi>Paſchall Feaſt,</hi> which is the whole ſcope of this dayes Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, telling us how our Saviour appeared in confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

THe Evangeliſt had in this Epiſtle, (and in the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate verſe before told us,) <hi>The love of God conſiſted in keeping his commands,</hi> and that <hi>his commands are not heavy,</hi> and this for divers reaſons, becauſe compared to the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous weighty precepts of the old ceremoniall Law they are nothing in a manner difficult at all; For there were (as <hi>Rabbi Moſes</hi> did reckon them in his third Book,) two hundred and eighteen affirmative, and three hundred ſixty five negative precepts of the old Law; which in the Law of Grace are reduced unto ten, and thoſe no other, then even any reaſonable man would exact of a creature to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and of one man towards another, for a quiet civill and honeſt neighbourhood; and though to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature, mortification may ſeeme hard, yet to ſound nature it is ſweet and appetible, at leaſt as medicine is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſick perſon: and as grace is the balſame, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our corrupted nature ſound againe, ſo taking grace into the conſideration as a help, more powerfull then any impediment, it is moſt true the Commandements are eaſie, to a gratious ſoule, to any one that hath in him the fear or
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:204830:247"/> love of God; whence the Evangeliſt inferres, that as by grace we are <hi>borne</hi> a new, to, in, and of God, ſo by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation our feeble nature is made able enough to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the world,</hi> all the enemies and obſtacles man hath betweene him and heaven, which is the inheritance of Gods children; whence Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> 
                              <q>ſaith excellently well in his firſt Sermon upon this day, it is an argument of our heavenly regeneration, or new birth, when we overcome temptations;</q> as therefore we are firſt borne children of God by Baptiſme, wherein we receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed vertues of Faith, Hope, and Charity, ſo by contrition and confeſſion after actuall ſinne, we are as it were new borne to God by his holy grace conferred on us againe, and bringing back with it all thoſe vertues and graces we had loſt by reiterated ſinnes. But we are ſpecially to note, that this Text ſaith, <hi>every thing that is borne of God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the world,</hi> not every man, becauſe it is not by any naturall <hi>thing</hi> in man, that he doth overcome ſinne, but by that which is ſupernaturall, to wit, <hi>Grace, Faith, Hope, Charity,</hi> and whence the Apoſtle ſaith immediately, and <hi>this is the victory which overcomes the world, our Faith;</hi> by the <hi>victory</hi> he meanes the cauſe of our <hi>victory,</hi> or the overcommer it ſelfe of the world; whereupon Saint <hi>Leo,</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and others ſaid oftentimes, a faithfull ſoule is farre greater then the world, and one who is in heaven, looks upon the earth as on a contemptible point: ſo that it was moſt truly ſaid of Saint <hi>Marke</hi> cap. 9. verſe. 23. <hi>All things are poſſible to him that beleeveth;</hi> nay we ſee a ſtrong and lively <hi>Faith</hi> hath in it a kinde of omnipotency, when it commands, as it were, that to be done, which none but God can do.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:204830:247"/> Martyrs elſe by dying conquer death, as Chriſt did on the Croſſe? but by dying for the <hi>Faith,</hi> and in the <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. None elſe indeed can doe it; for in beleeving this we are forced to oppoſe all other that deny it, and if in that oppoſition we loſe our lives, rather then our <hi>Faith,</hi> we get the <hi>Victory of all the world,</hi> that perſecutes us for it, and of death it ſelfe: for he that <hi>beleeves</hi> this, hopes in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and hoping cals upon him, and calling him to aide loves him, and loving him takes courage to defie all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, which are the world, the fleſh, and the devill, and in ſcorning them gets force to reſiſt them, and in reſiſting obtaines grace to <hi>overcome</hi> them.</p>

This <hi>for</hi> is a proper illative, he having ſaid before, the <hi>Spirit bore teſtimony,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt was verity,</hi> ſince the <hi>Spirit</hi> is one of the three in heaven, that give teſtimony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exceptions, namely Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, which is the very <hi>ſpirit</hi> that is mentioned, <hi>teſtifying</hi> as above in Chriſt his behalfe; ſo the ſcope of this verſe is, that all the three perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity give teſtimony to man and Angels, of Chriſt his being the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Son of God, ſent to redeeme the world: <hi>The Father</hi> in his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and Transfiguration, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> by comming downe upon him in the ſhape of a Dove, and by comming (as ſent from heaven by him) after his Aſcenſion, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his Apoſtles in grace on <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and <hi>the word,</hi> or ſecond perſon abundantly in all the myſteries of his life and death: and <hi>all theſe three are one,</hi> not in eſſence and divine nature onely, but even in their Teſtimonies of him, they all concurre in <hi>one</hi> and the ſame Truth.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> having cited <hi>three</hi> divine, or increated <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies</hi> of Chriſt his Deity, addes alſo <hi>three</hi> created <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies</hi> of the ſame Truth, the <hi>ſpirit, water, and bloud,</hi> which <hi>three,</hi> (to make a perfect Analogy between this double Trinity) he ſayes, <hi>are all one,</hi> meaning they have all one root, the Sacred Deity, in which they are ſanctified. The <hi>water</hi> repreſents the Father, the <hi>Bloud,</hi> the Son, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt: for as water was the firſt principle of all ſublunary things as in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion declared, ſo is the <hi>Father</hi> the creator of all the world, and as Chriſt by his own <hi>bloud</hi> ſaved us, ſo his Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs by their <hi>bloud,</hi> give <hi>teſtimony</hi> of him; as the Holy Ghoſt taught all truth to the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors, ſo <hi>that Spirit of Truth</hi> in the Holy Church, beares teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his infallible veracity, by whoſe holy <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines infallible. Take then this created Trinity thus, by <hi>Water</hi> Baptiſme, by <hi>Bloud</hi> Martyrdome, by the <hi>Spirit</hi> the charity of God diffuſed in our hearts; and <hi>theſe three are one;</hi> (in way of Teſtimony) or teſtifying all <hi>one</hi> thing, the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:204830:248"/> Deity of Chriſt, that he was true God, as well as man. So they are not <hi>one</hi> in nature, (as the increated Trinity is) but in office or <hi>Teſtimony</hi> they are all one and the ſame, yet may we ſay, they are even in nature all one too, if wee make the diviſion thus; that theſe three human teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were all one in Chriſt, as he was man, that is, the water and bloud out of his ſide, and the ſpirit his human ſoule, which he dying gave up to teſtifie he was a true man; and all theſe three may be ſaid one, as being ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts that integrated one whole Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. This verſe begins with an argument of ſimilitude, importing if we beleeve men, much more ought we to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve God, not that it implyeth, as if the Teſtimony that holy Church gives of truth were a <hi>humane Teſtimony</hi> onely, but yet creditable (even upon that account,) and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted (upon an other) that though men ſpeak, yet God dictates the Truth unto them, and ſo the Doctrine of the Church is not onely the Doctrine, nor <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of men, but alſo of God aſſiſting them, and thence it makes <hi>human-Divines,</hi> or <hi>Divine-Men:</hi> ſo in ſhort the ſence of this verſe is, whither the created or increated Trinity bear <hi>teſtimony</hi> of Chriſt his Deity, it is the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of God himſelfe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being, or working infallible Truth, whence Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 2 Epiſt. cap. 1. v. 21.

                           <p n="10">10. For many reaſons this is true, firſt becauſe he hath a thing <hi>teſtified</hi> by God, ſecondly the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that thing for none but God could reveale, that truth of Chriſt being <hi>the Sonne of God,</hi> (This was told Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and thence he was called by Chriſt <hi>Bleſſed?</hi> Matth. c. 16. v. 17.) thirdly becauſe <hi>this teſtimony</hi> is <hi>faith</hi> it ſelfe, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt gift of God, laſtly becauſe by this gift of <hi>Faith</hi> a man is regenerate, and made of the devils Son, to be <hi>the Son of God.</hi> The Prieſt asking firſt the baptized if he <hi>do beleeve</hi> Chriſt, and that profeſſed, then baptizeth immediately.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THe Illuſtration upon this Prayer, gives a great help to the preſent Application of this Text, unto our beſt advantage according to intention of the Holy Church: for ſeeing by the Paſchal Feaſt we underſtand the vertues that were proper thereunto, we muſt not exclude the maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of vertues which men have been hoarding up ſince Advent, (but eſpecially thoſe in Lent) towards making us more capable of the benefit of our Saviours <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> becauſe it is no leſſe vertue to conſerve what we have gotten, then it was to get the thing acquired: and wee ſhall then beſt conſerve thoſe vertues, when by frequent Acts thereof (as occaſion is adminiſtred) we make them perfect in us, and when our ſelves are perfected by them.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Now to ſhew the Church obſerves a method in her ſervices, as the three Theologicall vertues, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> are the maine roots of all Chriſtianity, and of all other vertues whatſoever: therefore from this time till we come againe to Advent, where we firſt began the Rules of Chriſtianity, there are three ſeaſons ſet a part for theſe Three Theologicall vertues, which are the three laſt miſteries of humane Redemption, the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereby we are to perfect our <hi>Faith,</hi> the Aſcenſion whereby we are to perfect our <hi>Hope,</hi> and the comming of the Holy Ghoſt, whereby we are to perfect our <hi>charity;</hi> as ſhall be ſaid at large of each when they occurr.</p>

                           <p n="19">19. That this apparition of Chriſt was his firſt to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and to them <hi>(for fear)</hi> aſſembled, (all, but <hi>Thomas</hi>) together in a Chamber in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> is moſt undoubted by this Text; which yet may ſeeme to claſh, with what the Angels ſaid to the <hi>Maries,</hi> as Saint <hi>Mark</hi> cap. 16. v. 7. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in the cloſe of laſt Sundayes Goſpel: For by that verſe it ſeemes, the <hi>Maries</hi> were to goe after the Apoſtles <hi>into Galilee,</hi> as if they had been fled <hi>for feare</hi> from <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> and as if Chriſt had promiſed his firſt apparition, after his reſurrection ſhould be in <hi>Galilee:</hi> but upon deliberate examine, it will be found the Angell ſpake of that appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>in Galilee</hi> as the moſt celebrated, becauſe it was before ſo great a number, as well of Diſciples, of Chriſt his friends) as before his Apoſtles, who were not onely his choſen ſervants, and his friends alſo, deſigned to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a higher ſervice, namely that of Apoſtolate. So this conſidered, there is no ſcruple of contradiction in the Evangeliſts, if here we finde Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſay this apparition of Chriſt to his Apoſtles aſſembled (ten of them) together in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was his firſt of all, though afterwards they fled for <hi>fear</hi> into Galilee, and had againe the honour to be preſent, when Chriſt did there appeare to above five hundred at once, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> avoucheth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. v. 6. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is evident by the Text of this verſe, that this was Chriſt his firſt apparition to his Apoſtles, becauſe it was <hi>late that day,</hi> namely on <hi>Eaſter day</hi> on Sunday <hi>the firſt of the Sabbath,</hi> ſo called from the dignity it had to be made (ever after) the firſt day of the Chriſtian week, and ſo their <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day,</hi> as bringing them newes of the eternall reſt, which Chriſt his <hi>reſurrection</hi> (upon that day) had purchaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:204830:251"/> them: and if we obſerve the ſtory, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> relates it, there was reaſon why it ſhould be <hi>late that day,</hi> for firſt, the <hi>Maries</hi> were to goe from the Tombe to the City; then <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> runing away before the reſt ſeemes firſt to have met <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> onely, and comming back with (or after) them, (who run to the Tombe to ſee if it were true, that <hi>Mary</hi> had told them) and returning afterwards to get together their whole number of Apoſtles if they could, (though with <hi>ſeare of the Iewes,</hi>) to conſult what was to be done by them, and in the meane time <hi>Mary</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming back to the Sepulchre, and weeping there, had the honour to have our Saviour appeare unto her, and then to goe open mouth to the Apoſtles, and to tell them, ſhe was not now to ſeek, but had found her Lord, and that he had told her he was to aſcend to his heavenly Father; ſo before all this was done, the day muſt needs paſſe a pace away, and therefore no marvell, <hi>it was late,</hi> when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour appeared, <hi>the doores being ſhut, where the Diſciples were gathered together,</hi> probably in the ſame roome where Chriſt (with them) made his laſt Supper. This place argues Chriſt may be in the Sacrament without extenſion of Parts, as well as he could with his whole Body enter into the room where his Apoſtles were, and had the <hi>doors cloſe ſhut</hi> upon them, <hi>for fear of the Jews,</hi> whatſoever the Hereticks pretend to the contrary; this being as ſtrange a Penetration, as the other is a Tranſubſtantiation, and a Celation or Covering the Order of his Corporeal Parts, not amaſſed nor confounded one with another, how ever, not requiring ſuch extenſion as is naturally requiſite to their dimenſions; ſince it is as eaſie for God to keep his real Body under the Sacramental Species without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſuration to place, as it was for him to paſs with his whole Body thorough the walls without diviſion made by his miraculous Penetration of their Parts: being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt grant this, becauſe his Apoſtle ſays it, how can they (with modeſty) deny the other, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe avouched, when he ſaid, <hi>Take and eat, this is my Body</hi>

But obſerve the firſt ſalute of our Saviour, ſaying <hi>peace be to you,</hi> which is to ſay, all good betide you; fear no more, I have fought your battailes, and bring you the tidings of a victorious <hi>peace,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, his coming hither was not upon his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but ours; So he tells them, now his buſineſs is done, their <hi>peace</hi> is made in Heaven and Earth.</p>

The <hi>joy</hi> which followed <hi>in the Diſciples</hi> upon ſeeing theſe <hi>wounds,</hi> was not that he had received them, but that thoſe notwithſtanding (and his Death to boot for the ſins of mankinde) they ſaw him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, merciful, ſweet, benigne unto them, that they did not ſee him come to reproach their flight from him, nor <hi>Peters</hi> denying of him, but to comfort them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidate their <hi>Faith,</hi> and in them the <hi>Faith</hi> of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in this now undoubted Truth, that as he became man, was crucified, dead and buried for ſatisfaction of our ſins, ſo now he aroſe from Death to Life, to give all mankinde an aſſurance, that the work of their redemption was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and their ſalvation ſecured (if they would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) hence it was <hi>the Apoſtles were glad</hi> to ſee our Lord riſen and alive, to confirm all his former Doctrine, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre the Jews malice againſt him, and their belief that they had put him to ſuch a death, as he was paſt all power of reviving.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:204830:252"/> the abundance of his goodneſs flowing ſtill from himſelf, and falling upon thoſe he loves; and further in teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that theſe his Apoſtles were all in the rank of thoſe he loved moſt, behold he gives his own moſt ample commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which he had from his heavenly Father unto every one of them; while he ſends them (in vertue of the ſame Commiſſion) to convert the whole world, as he himſelf was ſent firſt to redeem it, and by vertue of his Paſſion to convert it alſo, which yet he would not do, to have the whole honour of it to himſelf, but gives to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles the happineſs to be his inſtruments, his cooperators thereunto; as himſelf was the inſtrument of his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Father</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; and if we obſerve the force of our Saviours words, in giving his commiſſion of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolate to theſe his choſen Servants, we ſhall finde he doth not onely give them the title and honour of being his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but of being even ſo many <hi>Sons of God</hi> (by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, not by nature) while <hi>he ſends them even as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent him, to ſupply what was wanting of his Paſſion,</hi> as we have heard already explicated once or twice.</p>

                           <p n="23">23. How abſurdly doth <hi>Calvin</hi> wreſt this place to power of preaching, rather then he will allow man power of <hi>remitting ſins,</hi> though it be given him by God himſelf: This very corruption of ſo plain a place of Scripture ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, how dangerous a thing it is, for men to read and wreſt it to their own ſenſe; ſince the Act of Preaching is Teaching and Exhorting; the Act of forgiving ſins is the Act of a judging Power; beſides, all men may at all times be lawfully preacht unto, be they in ſin or out of ſin; but all cannot at all times be abſolved from ſin, nor any indeed, at any time but by Contrition, Confeſſion, and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:204830:256"/> and lives)</hi> is here commemorated in one of the chiefe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments thereof, the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt, ſince it was by his <hi>abaſement unto death,</hi> that we are <hi>raiſed up to life,</hi> and are imboldened to begge our <hi>joy</hi> may be <hi>perpetuall,</hi> who (by his temporall reſurrection) are <hi>taken out of the danger of eternall death,</hi> to the end we may not onely <hi>joy</hi> therein <hi>for ever,</hi> but even <hi>injoy perpetuall felicity</hi> thereby: But ſtay beloved! why doe we now eclipſe the glory of this Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivall, by mixing with it the memory of our Bleſſed Lords inglorious death? becauſe the Holy Ghoſt will have it ſo: firſt to ſhew us that it was an <hi>abaſement</hi> for the Son of God to remaine one minute out of the Kingdome of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father (though he were never ſo much triumphant over death) upon death; as alſo to indeer us the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Almighty God, who was content to give us glory by the infamy of his Sacred Sonne, but was not ſatisfied to give us, being out of the nothing we were, before he ſhewed his omnipotency by creating us, unleſs he had made his own Son by death, as it were, not to be, that ſo he might give us a ſecond being in grace, better then our firſt in nature; and unleſs our Saviours temporall death might give us life eternall, free from <hi>all danger,</hi> and injoying <hi>perpetuall felicity:</hi> yes, yes, the little Prayer above imports all this, and infinitely more then all we can imagine, who are not able to reach the depth of ſence, that lies under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of the holy Ghoſt; and ſuch we know are holy Churches Prayers; nor is there want of admirable ſweet connexion between this Prayer, and the Epiſtle and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of the day; for what doth all the former ſay, but that our Saviours <hi>abaſement</hi> was our exaltation, when Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in his Epiſtle tels us, we that are Chriſtians, are called to <hi>[ſuffer with Chriſt,]</hi> who gave us <hi>[example]</hi> by his ſufferings to <hi>[follow his ſteps,]</hi> even unto death for him, who did vouchſafe to dye for us. And is not this the full ſence of the Prayer? As for the Goſpell, if we look with a regardfull eye upon it, 'tis but the ſame ſence in other words;) for while it runs upon the nature of a Shepheard,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:204830:257"/> it never comes unto the hight of his commends, untill it layes him low as death to ſave his ſheep; ſo ſtill it drives to that <hi>abaſement,</hi> which is our exaltation, and drawes us ſweetly on to dye for him, while it gives us an example of confidence, that admits no fear; becauſe there is no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but in Truſt; and who can we truſt more ſafely, then him that knowes no <hi>[guile]</hi> our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who rather dyes in us, then we can dye for him; and if he dye, it is that we may live, and joy eternally with him, that by his reſurrection conquered death. Thus do the ſparkes of ſpirit flye from every letter of the Holy Text, when they are ſtrook againſt the ſteele of this dayes Prayer; and thus the high dignity of Paſtorate acquires a glory from the loweſt ſtoop the Paſtor makes even that to death; ſo in a word our higheſt ſanctity, conſiſts in our loweſt humility, as this dayes Prayer, Epiſtle and Goſpel do all avouch.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. HOw ſweetly Holy Church to day mixeth the Lay mans duty with that of the Prieſt, to ſhew us that what in an eminent degree Chriſt taught his Apoſtles (and conſequently their ſucceſſors, the Paſtors of Gods Church who by office have care of ſoules) in ſome ſort at leaſt the layty was to imitate; namely that heroicall, or rather that divine Act of Faith which is required to Martyrdom. For albeit the Prieſt be bound to many duties, which do not oblige Lay people, yet there is no man or woman whatſoever, that is not rigorouſly bound to lay down life it ſelfe (the deereſt thing they have) rather then deny their faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Againe however the Lay-man is not bound to that perfection of charity and Juſtice which the Prieſt ought to have, nor to excell in many other vertues eſſentially proper to the Prieſt as zeale of ſoules eſpecially) yet this
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:204830:259"/> dayes Epiſtle tels us, that every Chriſtian whatſoever, ſtands obliged thus far to imitate the perfection of Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe, as to preſerve the proper vertues of the Paſchall Feaſt <hi>ſincerity and verity,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, ſome degree of <hi>ſaintity</hi> as was declared in the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Epiſtle upon <hi>Eaſter</hi> day, and conſequently if all be bound to <hi>ſaintity,</hi> none are priviledg'd to <hi>ſinne,</hi> but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is to avoid it, as is told us in the ſecond verſe of this Epiſtle; none is priviledg'd <hi>to beguile,</hi> or defraud his neighbour, for that is contrary to the Paſchall <hi>ſincerity and verity,</hi> which all the Lambs of Chriſt are obliged unto.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To conclude, as all Chriſtians are rigorouſly bound to a profeſſion of the Faith of Chriſt with hazard of their lives, ſo this Epiſtle inſtructs them all in that particular duty of ſuffering for Juſtice in teſtimony of their Faith, and for that purpoſe layes before their eyes, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they are to ſuffer, juſt as Jeſus did, <hi>following his ſteps</hi> therein, <hi>Not reviling thoſe that revile them,</hi> not <hi>ſtraying</hi> away for fear, but like believing Lambs to follow <hi>their Paſtor the Biſhop of their ſoules;</hi> their Jeſus, and their God <hi>to whom they are converted</hi> by their faith in him, for whom they are to dye (if need be) as he hath dy'd for them, and by his humble death, hath raiſed them to the hopes of an eternall life, and of everlaſting joyes therein.</p>

                           <p>IT is admirable to ſee how many regards the Prayers of Holy Church have at once, as in this (beſides that of the Reſurrection which tranſcends * all the Prayers of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:204830:262"/> Church between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and the <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> and beſides that which is unto the Epiſtle and Goſpel of the day, as ſhall appear anon) we ſee here a ſpeciall regard unto the faint-hearted Chriſtians, who ſeeing Chriſt was dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, tottered in their <hi>Faith</hi> of his Deity, and <hi>went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray</hi> into a thouſand Meandrous doubts in point of <hi>Faith;</hi> for whoſe ſakes, (that <hi>they might returne to the way of Iuſtice</hi> by a right beliefe) Chriſt was pleaſed for forty dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dwell upon earth, meerly to confirme the truth of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> not onely infinitely doubted of, but even held impoſſible; and by his dwelling here ſo long, to <hi>ſhew them the light of his verity;</hi> which indeed was never ſo brightly ſeen, as when it was made appear by his <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> confirming all the <hi>Truths</hi> he had taught the world before his death: now that this Prayer reflects upon thoſe tottering Chriſtians, who lived then, when Chriſt aroſe, as well as upon all us that ſucceed them, ſee the following words point out ſuch, when the Prayer beggs, that <hi>thoſe who by profeſſion are eſteemed Chriſtians</hi> (as many were that yet doubted of the Reſurrection) may <hi>both eſchue thoſe things, that are contrary to this name</hi> (and nothing more contrary, then to doubt of Chriſts veracity, as theſe men did, who would not beleeve he was truly riſen, from death to life) and <hi>purſue thoſe, which are agreeable to the ſame,</hi> that is to ſay, may beleeve, and profeſſe their <hi>Faith</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or elſe they muſt diſagree from all he ſaid and taught beſides, if they did not agree to this ſo important a truth, and article of our Chriſtian beliefe. But now to our maine deſigne; ſee how this Prayer (like an Inviſible Soule) gives life to all the body of the Churches Service on this day, whileſt it tels us in generall termes the duty of good Chriſtians, which more particularly is ſummed up in the Epiſtle and Goſpel following: For what is that which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the former ſayes, more then this Prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, while he bids us walk here like <hi>[Strangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes, and refraine carnal deſires;]</hi> then that when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Chriſt his <hi>reſurrection,</hi> we ſhould follow the <hi>light

To conclude, this is alſo to beare patiently the viciſſitudes of <hi>[joyes]</hi> and <hi>[ſorrowes,]</hi> mentioned in the Goſpel, if [a <hi>while</hi>] we <hi>[See]</hi> comfort, and if <hi>[a while]</hi> after we <hi>[See it not,]</hi> This is to be content, Chriſt ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us, ſo the Holy Ghoſt come amongſt us in his roome; This is to be like teeming women, groaning here, and in <hi>[Travell]</hi> with the children of perſecution, paine, torments and death it ſelfe for Jeſus Chriſt: and <hi>[rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing]</hi> when we are delivered of the manly and heroick acts of vertue (the <hi>babes</hi> of <hi>grace</hi>) which will bring us a comfort, that <hi>[no man can take from us]</hi> a peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here, and a crowne of glory in the world to come: So we ſee how home this Prayer comes to all the whole Service of the day beſides.</p>

IT ſeemes there were in thoſe dayes faigned devotes of women, who under a pretence of piety intruded themſelves very officiouſly into the company of Church-men, but oftentimes it appeared their pretended piety was but <hi>carnality,</hi> covered under a vizard of devotion; and it is with ſpeciall regard to ſuch ſingularities, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous converſation with women, that the Apoſtle here ſpeakes both to Church-men, to thoſe women, and to all good Chriſtians in generall, <hi>beſeeching</hi> (out of his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) though he might have commanded them, that they

                                 </gap> pilgrimes,</hi> meere paſſengers upon this earth, ſince they are members of Chriſt, who as a <hi>ſtranger</hi> came into the world, when at his firſt birth he was (<hi>ſtranger</hi>-like) caſt out of doores, and not allowed <hi>a place in any houſe to lay his head in;</hi> ſo he was content to be borne in a manger, that by this meanes he might ſhew us, he came to looke us out, who were <hi>ſtragled</hi> from Paradiſe (baniſhed thence indeed) and made (like <hi>ſtrangers</hi>) wander over all the world. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly it is a deep word, if well reflected on, for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans here to call themſelves <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> ſince they have here, <hi>no dwelling place,</hi> but are Citizens of the heavenly Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and all their life time being as a <hi>pilgrimage,</hi> through the deſert of this wicked world. The Apoſtle ſtrongly perſwades, when he bids them take heed of ſetting their affections upon creatures here, for how abſurd were it, if a <hi>pilgrim</hi> or paſſenger, (whoſe life lay at ſtake, to be at ſuch a place, by ſuch a time where he was promiſed a preferment) ſhould yet doat upon ſome miſerable bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave in the road, and thereby not onely loſe his way home, but his preferment too; and binde himſelfe Prentice to an eternal bondage or ſlavery? And the Apoſtle ſpeakes all this very pathetically, very briefely under the notion of <hi>carnall deſires,</hi> which are indeed the greateſt enemies the ſoule hath, and doe clap the Irons of captivity ſooneſt and faſteſt upon her, no vice ſo ſurely, ſo ſpeedily inthralling ſouls, as <hi>carnality</hi> doth. See therefore how ſtrongly the Apoſtles charms under this notion of <hi>Pilgrim;</hi> ſince the very name ſhews the nature of the man, one that hath no right at all to any thing he ſees; one that even to eaſe his own labour, makes it his ſtudy to keep his right road, that longs for nothing more but to get home; that for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is content to toyl and moyl continually, and never to take long reſt; that dares offend none he meets, leſt as a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> all the natives riſe againſt him, to revenge the injury he did to any one of them. That looks on all he meets as <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to him, ſince he knows himſelf ſo to them;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:204830:264"/> that gets ready tacklings for his tedious journey, and caſts off all things elſe as cumberſom; that finding himſelf laught at by moſt he meets with, eſpecially all youth, for the Exotick habit, which he wears, regards not their flouts nor ſcorn,, but bears them patiently. Thus, thus the Apoſtle exhorts all Chriſtians to walk through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of this World: Note, by <hi>carnal deſires</hi> (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all he bids them refrain) he means all the works of <hi>the fleſh,</hi> all vice indeed, <hi>gluttony,</hi> as overloading, <hi>venery,</hi> as over-waſting, <hi>anger,</hi> as retarding, while others in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſtop his journey: and ſo of all the other fleſhly works, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> enumerates them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. which ſhall be explicated on the fourteenth Sunday after Pentecoſt.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. Since by <hi>Gentiles</hi> here are underſtood all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World, the Apoſtle tyes up Chriſtians to a very good and a cloſe guard, when he allows him not to uſe the leaſt miſcomportment before any one man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whatſoever; that ſo whom they cannot edifie by their words, at leaſt they may by their example: by <hi>miſreports</hi> he alludes here to the cenſure which the Gentiles made of all Chriſtians for wicked and lewd men, becauſe they found a Sect of Chriſtians called the Gnoſticks, who were originally deſcended from Chriſtians, that did indeed live wickedly, and defended their errors with obſtinacy: again, they held Chriſtians to be Cannibals and eaters of mans fleſh, becauſe in the Sacrament they received <hi>the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> and upon which groſs miſtake Chriſtians were perſecuted almoſt three hundred years, by thoſe who hearing of the thing, did not underſtand the myſtery: Now there is nothing indeed that ſo beats down <hi>ill reports</hi> of men, as to ſee their good works, for when thoſe are conſidered, God <hi>is</hi> preſently <hi>glorified,</hi> becauſe thoſe <hi>works</hi> proclaime God to be within the men that do them. By <hi>the day of viſitation,</hi> is here underſtood literally the examine of thoſe falſe reports before Judges, as then <hi>Plinius</hi> (a Gentile) was a Judge in thoſe days; myſtically when by comparing your good deeds with the bad ones
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:204830:265"/> of your Detractors, that day of ſuch examine may <hi>glorifie God</hi> by the converſion of the wicked; laſtly, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding you ſuffer upon falſe accuſations even death it ſelf, that the wicked finding how ſtrong God is in the juſt, may be converted upon this <hi>day of viſitation</hi> to the juſt, who dyes temporally himſelf, that others may live to God eternally.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. This Illative <hi>therefore</hi> is aptly taken up after the precedent Exhortation: For it was a calumny then laid upon the Chriſtians by the Infidels, that they as <hi>Subjects</hi> and Children of God, were exempt from all obedience to man. And the Apoſtle brings in this <hi>ſubjection</hi> here, as one part of perfect <hi>converſation</hi> and good life in Chriſtians; and to ſhew how little this miſreport againſt Chriſtians was the Apoſtolical Doctrine; ſee here, the head of the Apoſtles commands a <hi>ſubjection</hi> ſo large, that he will have it extend to all, from all men, as part of the Chriſtian Doctrine, that is, to all Superiours over all men of what Religion ſoever; to ſhew that none are, and ought to be more truly obedient and humble, then Chriſtians, who obey not onely Superiours, but Equals and Inferiours too, as St. <hi>Paul, Galat.</hi> 5.13. exhorts by <hi>charity of the Spirit, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one another.</hi> Note by <hi>humane creature,</hi> is here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood men, as it were, made by men, or created by men, Superiours, who were before but Equals; For as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtrictly taken gives being out of nothing, ſo in a large ſence (and here it is thus meant) creation of a king makes him to have a moral Being, which before he had not. The like is of all Superiority Political: and to make this <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> the more acceptable, he bids it be for <hi>Gods ſake,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though men chooſe men for Governours, yet God ſo ordains, that man by man ſhall be governed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an act of Religion, to be obedient to man <hi>in power,</hi> as to Gods appointed vicegerent; and hence it was that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> fained, he had his Laws dictated to him by the Gods: next we are to look upon Princes, as Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> adviſe, ſaying, <hi>who reſiſteth power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:204830:265"/> the ordination of God,</hi> and for <hi>reſiſting acquires to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf damnation,</hi> Rom. 13.2. Again, it is <hi>by God, Kings</hi> (and other Magiſtrates) <hi>rule, Prov.</hi> 8.15. as who ſhould ſay, the obedience we pay to man ought to be in teſtimony of our obedience to God, ſetting man over us, and requiring te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of our Love to him by obedience to his vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; that Chriſtians obeying Infidels may gain them to an obedience unto Gods commands. Finally, that Princes ſo command, as they remember themſelves to be Gods Subjects, however mens Superiours; and this is to <hi>obey for Gods ſake.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="14">14. See here obedience to <hi>Captains,</hi> or any other <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi> is commanded as to men <hi>ſent</hi> by the <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>States</hi> to govern; by <hi>puniſhing the bad,</hi> and <hi>praiſing the good;</hi> for hence the Good receive praiſe, when Malefactors are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for offending them, and when they will rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unjuſtly the oppreſſing of the wicked, then do unjuſtly, or become themſelves unjuſt.</p>

                           <p n="20">20. Wherein he tells them, as in the two Sences above, Verſe 16. That <hi>his Diſciples</hi> and all good men ſhould <hi>here weep,</hi> while the bad men of the <hi>world</hi> did <hi>rejoyce,</hi> but that as the temporal <hi>ſorrow</hi> of the juſt ſhould be turned into eternal <hi>joy,</hi> ſo the temporal <hi>joy</hi> of the unjuſt ſhould be turned into eternal <hi>grief;</hi> or rather that you who are my friends, ſhall <hi>weep</hi> to ſee me ſuffer and dye, while my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the Jews ſhall <hi>rejoyce</hi> thereat, you being ſad in the mean time, but as by my reſurrection your <hi>ſorrow</hi> ſhall be turned into <hi>joy,</hi> ſo their <hi>joy</hi> ſhall be turned into <hi>ſorrow</hi> and confuſion; not for love to me, but for ſhame of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. For divers reaſons the <hi>ſorrow</hi> of the Diſciples at Chriſts death was compared to the pains of a <hi>woman with childe,</hi> and their <hi>joy</hi> at his Reſurrection, to the <hi>joy</hi> of a <hi>woman delivered of a Son,</hi> after a hard labour: Firſt, becauſe both theſe Griefs were very Bitter, Secondly, both Short, Thirdly, both full of Danger, Fourthly, both converted into after <hi>Joy,</hi> ſuitable to their Sorrows, Fifthly, becauſe as the ſame childe was firſt cauſe of pain, ſo he is cauſe of <hi>comfort,</hi> the like of Chriſt dying and riſing again, Sixthly, both <hi>joys</hi> are exceſſive Great, whereas they take away all ſenſe of Sorrow. So here the Paſſion of Chriſt is in this Parable, ſuppoſed to be the labour or travail of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>dolorous</hi> as a womans in childe-bearing, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is ſuppoſed to be as the Birth of a Son to them, after ſo hard a labour as they were in, whileſt all the world
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:204830:268"/> jeered and ſcorned them, for hoping after ſo impoſſible a comfort, as it was thought, when the Apoſtle calls it a <hi>ſcandal</hi> to <hi>the Jews,</hi> and to <hi>the Gentiles</hi> a <hi>folly.</hi> St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> is ſo acute upon this place, as to ſay Chriſt compared the Apoſtles <hi>ſorrow</hi> for his Paſſion, to the pains of a <hi>woman in labour</hi> of a Boy, and not of a Girl, becauſe thoſe are the greateſt labours of women: and again, he makes a ſpecial remark, that the Text ſaith here, the Mother for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets her pains, not becauſe a Boy is born, but <hi>a man,</hi> one that is to be the Support and Prop of her houſe, when her ſelf can no longer live; for ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Chriſt was, as it were, born by his Reſurrection to the World, not as a Childe, but as <hi>a Man;</hi> conquering Death, winning eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory to himſelf and to all his Poſterity, to all Saints of Heaven, who are the Children of his Grace.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. This Verſe applies all the reſt by way of Repetition to the Senſes as above, while it tells the Apoſtles, this ſhall be their Caſe about him, this their Grief at his Death, this their Joy at his Reſurrection, like the <hi>travail</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> of <hi>a woman</hi> firſt in labour, then <hi>delivered</hi> of a Son: But when he adds this Cloſe, That <hi>their joy no man ſhall take from them,</hi> he means neither in this world, nor in the next; for ſuch ſhall be their <hi>joy</hi> to ſee Chriſt riſen, who was dead, that even the menace of Death to themſelvcs ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, out of their aſſurance, to ſhare with Chriſt in <hi>the joy of his Reſurrection,</hi> if they partake with him in the pains of Death, by dying for his ſake.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:204830:270"/> hold a whole Sermon in a few lines; what preacher need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth other Text then this Prayer, to dilate upon even till the day of Judgement? ſhall I ſpeak a big word upon this Prayer? be it but with us, as this day we pray, and we are even with God himſelf; at our journeys end: and why ſhould we deſpair thereof? ſince in vain we are bid to pray for this, if it were not (by Prayer) to be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. beg it then, beloved, on your often bended knees, beg it earneſtly, fervently, heartily, and doubt not but it will be granted, for God doth not feed us with fond hopes, of what he will not grant, if we ſo a k it, as we ought. But ſtay, how comes it, that with ſo much plenty of Spirit we finde to day ſo little ſeeming connexion with the Epiſtle and Goſpel, which yet I am confident will prove both as it were eminentially contained in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Prayer? And firſt obſerve how ſuitable it is for holy Church to pray thus, when we are now in the time, that Jeſus Chriſt prepared his Apoſtles to be content to leave him, or at leaſt, that he ſhould leave them. How often did he command them reſignation on all occaſions to the will of Almighty God? was not this the very form of his Prayer? <hi>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven,</hi> Matth. 6.10. Hence the Church begs to day, that we <hi>who believe in Chriſt, may live all of one minde:</hi> and ſince it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible, ſo many men ſhould be conſenting all in one; therefore we ſee the prayer gives that to God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is he muſt <hi>make</hi> that to be, which we beg; he muſt gives us grace, ſince we are <hi>all one</hi> in Faith, to be <hi>all of one minde</hi> in the operations of that belief, <hi>which works by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> that knows not <hi>[thine]</hi> and <hi>[mine]</hi> but gives all to God, and takes onely from his Holy Hand, what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to give back again. Next we pray, that <hi>we may love what God commands,</hi> which in this caſe was (to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) that they might love to leave our Bleſſed Lord, for ſo God had commanded, That <hi>they might deſire what he promiſed,</hi> which was the coming of the holy Ghoſt. <hi>That amongſt worldly varieties, there they might fix their hearts,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:204830:270"/> where onely true joys are to be had.</hi> O! what a taking off their mindes was this even from himſelf? whoſe departure was one of the <hi>worldly varieties</hi> he would not have to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, but that they ſhould upon the loſs of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs they had in his ſociety, <hi>fix their hearts</hi> on a greater happineſs (who but the holy Ghoſt could make this good) upon <hi>the joys of heaven,</hi> which are <hi>true joys</hi> indeed; and this alſo ſhews we are ſtill ſliding down the Channel of <hi>the Reſurrection</hi> too in this Prayer, as hath been ſaid. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God! how good art thou to man, who haſt made him a happineſs greater then the company of thy ſacred Son, whom yet we know is God and man too? the reaſon was his Humanity here did ſhade his Divinity; but in heaven his Deity ſhall outſhine his Humanity, and ſo make us love man in him for Gods ſake, whereas here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did love God but for Chriſts ſake, as he was man; and therefore this Prayer (as it ſpeaks the Apoſtles parts) bids them <hi>fix their hearts upon true joys</hi> indeed, thoſe onely that are in heaven, being greater then any they could have in the ſociety of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, ſo long as he was upon earth: not that his Glory was leſs here then in heaven, but that man is leſs capable to ſee God on earth, then he ſhall be to ſee and enjoy him too, when he comes to heaven; and therefore hee ought not to <hi>fix</hi> his <hi>heart</hi> upon any content whatſoever upon earth, but ſtill to keep it moving towards a greater and a <hi>truer Joy.</hi> And thus having made way for the Application of this Prayer unto our ſelves (by ſeeing how in the Apoſtles ſence we ought to ſay it;) let us cloſe with our accuſtomed Application of it, to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle and Goſpel of the day, or rather of them both unto it, which are, as it were, eminentially contained therein. And firſt there is nothing ſo cleer, as that it is <hi>[a gift]</hi> of God to make us thus reſigned; hence the Epiſtle breaks out into that acknowledgement, ſaying, [<hi>every good</hi> and <hi>perfect gift</hi> is <hi>from above deſcending from the Father of Lights, with whom there is no tranſmutation, nor ſhadowing of alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and who by his own ſacred word hath ingrafted in us a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:204830:271"/> filiation, that makes us be a beginning of his creature]</hi> that is, willing by our reſignation, to be made through his holy Grace, his better <hi>[creature]</hi> then by nature we are. And ſo in brief to be thoſe Saints, which St. <hi>Iames</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſets before our eyes, and conſequently thoſe which the Apoſtles were, when our Saviour had prepared them for his departure from them, and told them, they <hi>were not inquiſitive</hi> enough after the heavenly <hi>joys,</hi> whileſt they doted too much upon his Humane preſence, after he had made them believe, it was <hi>expedient (even for themſelves) that he left them, and that the holy Ghoſt came to them,</hi> in his ſtead, to all thoſe purpoſes that are recited in the Goſpel following; and to all which purpoſes we ſhall finde this Prayer availing us, if in this ſence we ſay it often, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by take (as in a little Cordial) the whole ſubſtance of the Epiſtle and Goſpel of this day.</p>

                           <p n="17">17. IT is prodigiouſly ſtrange to ſee how much the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here ſpeaks in Little, under theſe two terms of <hi>beſt gift,</hi> and <hi>perfect gift;</hi> for though the ſimple and literal meaning be, that all which is good amongſt men, is given them from God, and all which is bad amongſt them comes from the Devil, and from their own concupiſcence, yet there is a far deeper ſence couched alſo here; and firſt, under <hi>beſt gift,</hi> is underſtood not onely the goodneſs of the thing given, but the excellent good will of the giver, and even that, being as good as the gift, adds much to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue thereof; for indeed as man hath nothing of his own to give, ſo he hath no will of his own, nor deſire to give any thing that is good, but even that good will is Gods, and <hi>comes from God</hi> inſpiring man to do good unto his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but the ſence is yet deeper by the reduplication of <hi>perfection</hi> upon the goodneſs of the donation or giving, and of the gift given; as who ſhould ſay, <hi>Gods gifts</hi> are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goodneſs in themſelves, (by being communications of his infinite goodneſs to us) but they are alſo moſt <hi>perfect,</hi> both as their intrinſecal goodneſs makes them ſo, and as their extrinſecal operations and effects do make us ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unto whom they are given; ſince the end for which they are given, is, that man (by means thereof) may be <hi>perfect</hi> as Chriſt was <hi>perfect:</hi> again, many men give often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that, which obligeth others, and yet is not either <hi>perfect</hi> in it ſelf, or properly their own to give; neither of which can be wanting, when God is the donation, <hi>the gift,</hi> the perfection, and all that can be imaginable to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>gift,</hi> or the donation of it <hi>good</hi> and <hi>perfect, beſt</hi> indeed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:204830:272"/> and moſt abſolutely accompliſhed. Again, by <hi>all gifts</hi> are here underſtood thoſe of Nature, Grace, and Glory, whereof each is from God ſo immediately, as none of them can flow from any other fountain: ſince he is <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra naturans,</hi> as Divines call him, and we <hi>Natura naturata,</hi> he is the Fountain, Origin, and firſt Principle of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he is a ſimple and perfect Nature, in, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo fecund or fertil, as he is able to branch himſelf out into an infinity of other Natures, which yet ſhall all be as diſtinct from his own Divine Nature, as Creatures are from their Creator, and from one another too. But the very truth is the Apoſtle here reports, to the two latter ſorts of <hi>gifts,</hi> namely thoſe of Grace and Glory; for he had before ſpoken much of <hi>Faith, Grace, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> all of them ſeeds planted in the ſouls of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, purpoſely to render them the fruits of Glory in the next World. To conclude, Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi> will have the word <hi>Datum,</hi> that is, <hi>the thing given,</hi> to mean the <hi>gift</hi> of Glory in the next world; as who ſhould ſay, all God gives here is to make us <hi>good,</hi> all he gives in Heaven is to make us <hi>perfect;</hi> others (and they not unproperly) ſay, by the <hi>beſt</hi> and moſt <hi>perfect gift</hi> here mentioned, is meant our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who is indeed all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all perfection; and ſo it is well ſaid, that when God gave us his onely Son, <hi>how is it poſſible he muſt not with him have given us all things?</hi> but we may alſo conceive the Apoſtle here gives all Chriſtians a general rule to ask of God nothing, but what is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> becauſe he can give nothing elſe, being himſelf all goodneſs and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And ſince Chriſt was the beſt pledge of this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of this perfection, that ever man was witneſs off, he coming from his heavenly Father, it is by conſequence true, that all the good we can hope for, muſt come from the ſame Fountain, the ſame heavenly Father; who is therefore called the <hi>Father of Light,</hi> becauſe he is the Fountain of in <hi>acceſſible Light:</hi> and indeed by the <hi>Father of Light,</hi> is here underſtood the whole ſacred Trinity; Firſt,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:204830:272"/> becauſe God is <hi>ad intra,</hi> as Divines ſpeak, meaning in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Majeſty, Glory, and Light, inacceſſible, as was ſaid above: again, as in this Trinity there are three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo every one of them is properly called a <hi>light;</hi> as of the Son we are told by the Nicene Council, that he is <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>light,</hi> or the <hi>Light</hi> of the eternal Father, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the holy Ghoſt is <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>lights,</hi> proceeding both from the Father, and from the Son, whence ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church calls the holy Ghoſt <hi>lumen cordium,</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>hearts;</hi> and St. <hi>Dennis</hi> explicates the myſtery of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity by <hi>light,</hi> in which are three Properties, Light, Splendor, and Heat; for as light without its own loſs produceth the other two, ſo the Father without his own loſs begets his Son, who is called <hi>Splendor patris, the Splendor of the Father;</hi> and from them proceed the holy Ghoſt, called Love, which is not onely a Heat, but a Fire of Charity burning eternally bright between the three ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſons, Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt: Secondly, becauſe God <hi>ad extra,</hi> that is to ſay, without himſelf, is the Origen of <hi>light,</hi> as he created Angels, the chief of whom being for his exceſſive brightneſs called <hi>Lucifer;</hi> and the reſt having power, each Superiour of them to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate his Inferiour Angel. Alſo as he created man endowed with the excellent <hi>light</hi> of reaſon, by which he was able to enlighten the ſouls of thoſe that are ignorant in the knowledge of Truth: Thirdly, as he created the Sun, Moon, and Stars, all gallant <hi>lights</hi> uſeful to creatures in this world: Fourthly, as he is the Author of all Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural <hi>lights,</hi> namely, of Faith, Hope, and Charity, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Underſtanding, Counſel, and all other Vertues what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and Graces, that are the <hi>lights</hi> guiding our ſouls to eternal Bliſs amidſt the myſty darkneſs of death and ſin: Fifthly, as he is the Author of all prophetical Spirits, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing by the <hi>light</hi> of Revelation things to come. Laſtly, as he is the Author of the <hi>light</hi> of Glory, a creature ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith, God cannot make it perfecter; his reaſon is, becauſe it is the <hi>medium</hi> to ſhew us perfection
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:204830:273"/> it ſelf, his own ſacred Deity, and without the help of this Glory elevating the powers of Angels and bleſſed Souls of men, neither of them could behold this <hi>inacceſſible light,</hi> which is God himſelf; but whether this light of Glory may not be anſwerable to the more or leſs Grace in Saints or Angels, and conſequently an accident more or leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe or perfect accord, to the exigence of every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſubject in which it is; we ſhall rather leave to Schools to diſpute with St. <hi>Thom.</hi> then preſume here to determine; <hi>with whom,</hi> that is with which <hi>Father of Light,</hi> with which ſacred Trinity, there is no <hi>Tranſmutation,</hi> no going from place to place, as all other <hi>lights</hi> do, eſpecially the Sun from Eaſt to Weſt; nor no <hi>viciſſitude</hi> of <hi>over-ſhadowing,</hi> no Eclypſe or Darkneſs by the Interpoſition of any thing between God and his creatures, or by his receſs from them, as the Sun goes from us, and ſo makes night, called viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinal <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and comes to us, and ſo makes day, called viciſſitudinal <hi>light;</hi> becauſe it comes and goes by fits, by turns, by changes, by alterations, whereas in God there is none of theſe to be found; for his <hi>light</hi> doth not come and go, he is not now Author of Grace, now of ſin, but all that comes from him is Grace, and if ſin interpoſe, it is from us that interpoſition comes: nor doth his Glory to the Bleſſed fade at any time, grow dark or dim, but keeps ſtill the ſame fulneſs of luſtre, it hath at firſt: but God is ſo far from mutability, that he is from five remarkable Heads immutable; Firſt, by nature Immortal; Secondly, by quality (as we call it) Vnalterable; Thirdly, by place Immoveable, becauſe immenſe and filling all place; Fourthly, by Will conſtant, ever the ſame in Reſolution; Laſtly, by Operation, ever here with Grace, ever in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with Glory working upon his Creatures; and all theſe four laſt flow as from their origin out of his Immortal and Eternal Nature; nay that which is moſt remarkable is to think, how in all the viciſſitudes and changes that Chriſt Jeſus felt in himſelf for us (as man) he was not the leaſt altered as he was God, but therefore became man, that he
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:204830:273"/> might incourage us to beare patiently, the changings and turnings of corrupted nature, when he that was God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelfe to the like, leſt we ſhould deſpaire of ever coming to an unalterable eternity of bliſs from amidſt ſo great a privation of reſt, as this perpetually <hi>altering</hi> world produced in us.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. This verſe proves God is not the Author of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or ſin in us; ſince he hath <hi>freely begotten</hi> us to be his children, children of his own inacceſſible <hi>light:</hi> and this generation alſo is that <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>perfect gift,</hi> which in the verſe above we heard <hi>came from God;</hi> but this word <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily</hi> is of deep ſenſe, and alludes to the difference where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God begot his own naturall and eternall Son, namely naturally and neceſſarily, ſo that he could not chooſe but beget him from all eternity, coequall to himſelfe; but our generation was gratuit, free, <hi>voluntary,</hi> whereby we were in time begotten, and ſo, as God might have choſen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would or not, have gotten us to be his children of grace, and not of nature, infinitely inferiour, no wayes coequall to him: againe, by <hi>voluntarily</hi> is underſtood not only <hi>gratis,</hi> but alſo by deſigne, as it is diſtinguiſhed from hazard, fortune, chance; beſides we are three ſeverall times begotten; firſt by nature or creation, ſecondly by grace and regeneration in Baptiſme remitting originall ſinne, thirdly by grace and pennance remitting actual ſin, though the Apoſtle here alludes only to the two laſt ways of our regeneration, as is cleer by what followes, ſaying we are thus begotten <hi>by the word of truth,</hi> which is firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, by the ſecond perſon of the Trinity, becoming man to ſave us, who were before Gods creatures, but the devils children by the guilt of ſinne: and he is truly called <hi>the word of truth,</hi> who is truth it ſelfe; ſecondly, <hi>the word of truth</hi> alludes to the promiſe of redemption made by God to <hi>Abraham</hi> through one of his ſeed Jeſus Chriſt; Thirdly, <hi>the word of truth</hi> may allude to the Sacramentall words, that are moſt <hi>true,</hi> I <hi>Baptize,</hi> I <hi>abſolve thee;</hi> fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt literally, by <hi>the word of truth</hi> is underſtood the

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:204830:281"/> Church appoints this Prayer: it is that <hi>week,</hi> when our Saviour bid his Apoſtles (and in them us too) ask, what they could wiſh, before he left them, to work out that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which he is going to ſecure them of in Heaven, according to their working. And 'tis a Petition large enough to all purpoſes, for if we always <hi>think</hi> and <hi>do right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> we cannot fail of being ſaved; nor will it clog our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in his aſcending up to Heaven, that by this Petition all the world tye themſelves faſt about him, ſince we know his own words, <hi>When I ſhall be exalted from the earth I will draw all things to my ſelf,</hi> Joh. 12.32. Again, it is no marvel, ſince here we ask of God to inſpire us to <hi>think on thoſe things which are good,</hi> that we firſt confeſs <hi>all good things proceed from him;</hi> for indeed from our ſelves we know, there cannot come any one good thought: as little mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel it is, that we begg, he will <hi>govern us,</hi> in <hi>putting our good thoughts in execution,</hi> in doing <hi>the good,</hi> which by his Grace we <hi>think</hi> to do; for ſo little are the good deeds we do our own, that it is both from God we are inſpired to <hi>think</hi> of doing good, and to put our good thoughts in <hi>execution.</hi> And yet ſo good God is, that he accepts (as our works) what he alone inables us to do. When will man do this? what maſter is there that doth not look for the profit (and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour too) of all the pains his ſervant takes? whereas God gives us not onely the honour of our own labours, but the profit alſo of his own pains taken in our behalfs, whileſt Heaven is given to man in conſideration of the Death of Chriſt. But we muſt ſee how this Prayer ſuits with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of this days ſervice: and firſt with the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> truly it is ſo ſuitable, that it exhauſts it entirely, while we pray, we may not onely <hi>think well,</hi> but <hi>do well</hi> alſo, as St. <hi>James</hi> in the firſt verſe of this Epiſtle bids us, ſaying, <hi>[Be doers of the word of God, not hearers onely]</hi> and the like is of all the other Counſels given in this Epiſtle, for as they are the <hi>inſpirations</hi> of the holy Ghoſt, ſo we pray to day, we may be <hi>governed</hi> in the <hi>execution</hi> thereof.

The reaſon why a man ſooner <hi>forgets</hi> his own face then anothers, is, becauſe he never ſees his own but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected Species in a Glaſs, which are therefore weaker and leſs vigorous, then if they came directly to his eye as thoſe of another mans countenance do, both directly, and more frequently ſeen by any man, then his own. So no wonder, if a man ſee and <hi>conſider</hi> himſelf never ſo exactly for a time, that he ſoon <hi>forgets</hi> himſelf, and covets to ſee himſelf again, whereas he much more perfectly remembers the Face and Features of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſon, then his own. Now though it be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for a man to look much into a material <hi>Glaſs,</hi> which can onely ſhew him the outward man, yet it is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable for him to look into the ſpiritual Glaſs of Gods Word, to read or hear that often, thereby to ſee what is wanting to that ornament of Grace or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which ſhould render him a perfect image of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: but beſides this often looking on himſelf, he muſt be <hi>doing</hi> and practiſing upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, namely, adding this Vertue, taking away that Vice, or elſe he onely looks and forgets what he ſee, or what he ſhould make himſelf to be. Note, there are
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:204830:283"/> three kindes of <hi>hearers</hi> of Gods word; the lazy, the active the contemplative; the firſt <hi>heare</hi> onely, and <hi>forget</hi> (indeed contemne) the next <hi>heare</hi> and obey; the third <hi>heare,</hi> and dye imbracing it with all the powers of their ſoules, and never let goe their imbracement again; many are the Analogies betweene a <hi>glaſs,</hi> and the <hi>word</hi> of God; for firſt, as in a <hi>glaſs</hi> is ſeene, not a picture of a thing, but the thing it ſelfe by a reflected ſpecies, though not by a direct one; ſoe by the <hi>word</hi> is ſeene the wil of God, nay, God himſelf; (ſince the <hi>word</hi> of the minde is ſeene by the <hi>word</hi> of the mouth) as <hi>in a glaſs.</hi> Againe as flat or plaine glaſſes repreſent the ſpecies equall to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but convex or round glaſſes repreſent them leſs then they are, and both the further off, the weaker they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them; ſo the <hi>word</hi> of God plainly, ſincerely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any crooked intention hearkened unto, or read, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents truly the will of God unto us; but if we make this <hi>word</hi> a convex <hi>glaſs.</hi> (one ſwollen up with a bulk of pride or ambition to wreſt it to our crooked ſenſes) then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the wil of God abridged, ſhortned or leſſened, not entirely and plainely, as it is in it ſelfe: whence preachers muſt learne to be <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>faithfull</hi> in the expoſition of holy writ: Againe as concave or hollow <hi>glaſſes</hi> placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sun are apt to caſt a heat and burne whatſoever combuſtible matter is neere them; ſo the <hi>word</hi> of God looked on with an humble eye, a dinted heart, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it makes the hollow of a ſweet impreſſion) ſets on fire all the inordinate appetites to ſinne, burns up all the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of vicious inclinations, and renders a ſoule burning bright in flames of love to Almighty God.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. By this verſe it is cleer, that the <hi>word</hi> of God is the <hi>glaſs</hi> here alluded unto; becauſe the <hi>Law of perfect liberty</hi> is that <hi>word</hi> of God, the <hi>Law</hi> and life of Jeſus Chriſt, whereby we are made children of God, not ſlaves to empty ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies onely, as they under the ſlaviſh Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> were, he that hath <hi>looked</hi> fixedly, not ſlightly into the <hi>glaſs</hi> of <hi>perfect liberty,</hi> and hath <hi>remained in it, not made a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:204830:284"/> hearer, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed,</hi> becauſe <hi>his deed</hi> ſhal deſerve a <hi>bleſſing</hi> by being ſuch, as this <hi>glaſs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it ſhould be; note by <hi>perfect liberty</hi> is not here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>liberty</hi> to doe what we liſt, ſo we beleeve aright, (as <hi>Luther</hi> hence pretended) but firſt, by <hi>liberty</hi> is here underſtood that which freeth us from the ſervility of the Moſaical Law, next that which freeth us from the ſlavery to ſinne and the devil, thirdly, that which freeth us from compulſion or feare, but leaves us free to doe wel out of pure love to God, not for fear of hel; fourthly that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which by reſurrection we ſhal have from death, when we ariſe to life everlaſting: further by the cloſe of this verſe ſaying, <hi>that man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed,</hi> is meant he ſhal have the bleſſing here of grace, in the next world of glory; and that his <hi>bleſſing</hi> ſhal be given to his doing, not to his contemplating what is to be done.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. By this place Saint <hi>James</hi> alludes to what he ſaid in the nineteenth verſe of this Epiſtle, of being <hi>quick to heare,</hi> and <hi>ſlow to ſpeak,</hi> and <hi>not to be angry,</hi> for by the laxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the tongue the hands are, as it were, tyed up from action, and thoſe men ſeldom do wel, that are alwayes tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or vaunting in many words the little good they doe in deeds, ſo that one kinde of doing the Law is a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſilence, (for religion imports as much, as a binding up of the Law) which conſiſteth in obſerving or doing it, not in talking of it: by the word, <hi>bridling our tongues</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated, as if the tongue were an unruly beaſt, alwayes running away from reaſon, unleſs <hi>bridled</hi> in; thereby; by <hi>ſeducing his heart,</hi> is underſtood making it erre; for a talking man ſeldome deceives others, but often himſelfe, ſince they ſee the ſin of petulance in his heart, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard as little what he ſaith, as himſelf doth what he ſpeaks, who is never doing wel, whileſt he ſpeaketh too much, (or ill:) and <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>mans religion is truly vaine;</hi> by <hi>religion</hi> is here underſtood either that vertue <hi>of religion,</hi> which makes a man render all his actions good towards God and his neighbor, (and is the firſt of moral vertues, as charity

Next <hi>religion</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelfe to the obſervance of the Law, and ſo it addes good workes <hi>to Faith:</hi> Thirdly, it is called the profeſſion <hi>of Faith,</hi> as Chriſtianity is the profeſſion of the Law of Chriſt, laſtly by <hi>religion</hi> is underſtood taking vowes to ſuch a particular rule of a religious order, as Saint <hi>Benedicts,</hi> Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> Saint <hi>Bernards,</hi> or the like: now <hi>loquacity</hi> is contrary to all theſe ſenſes; firſt as daring to ſpeak idly, rather then to heare the word of God and his worſhip wel inculcated unto us; next becauſe oftentimes great talkers are violators of the Law of God, by detraction from others or from their own integrity, ſpeaking ſometimes contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their own thoughts, and ſo truly <hi>ſeducing their owne hearts:</hi> Thirdly, becauſe Chriſtians in the primitive Church were noted, by refraining from the <hi>garrulity</hi> of the Gentiles: Laſtly, becauſe <hi>garrulity</hi> is diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to religious ſilence, a perfection much aymed at by all religious orders; ſo in theſe ſenſes, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> inveighs againſt much talking, or loquacity.</p>

Now ſince <hi>Regation weeke</hi> imports as much as <hi>Aske and Have,</hi> and ſince we never Aske but what we <hi>Hope</hi> to obtaine, therefore it was neceſſary to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten this day the firſt linke of <hi>Hope</hi> unto the laſt linke of our <hi>Faith,</hi> that which tels us how to perfect our <hi>beliefe,</hi> in good and ſaving workes as above.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:204830:288"/> can deſire nothing, but what Chriſt himſelfe doth wiſh we had, and conſequently we <hi>aske</hi> it very properly <hi>in his name,</hi> it being anſwerable to his will: But the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine of all theſe, is the ſecond way, by that of Chriſt his merits, for what we aske thus, is not given to us onely by way of grace, but it is granted by way of Juſtice, ſince it was merited unto us by Chriſt dying for us, and wiſhing it unto us: and for this reaſon we end all our Prayers with the cloſe <hi>through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: Amen.</hi> The laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark we are to make is upon thoſe words, <hi>he ſhall grant unto you,</hi> that is to ſay, what e're we <hi>ask</hi> as above, ſhall be granted, how comes it then to paſs, we <hi>ask</hi> ſo often, and ſo many things, and goe without them for all this <hi>asking?</hi> the reaſon is, that affirmative promiſes are commonly conditionall: ſo if we <hi>aske,</hi> without performing the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions required, on our part, we cannot wonder that we faile; and the conditions requiſite to Prayer (on our part) muſt be thoſe five above enumerated, <hi>humility, reverence, confidence, fervour</hi> and <hi>perſeverance,</hi> whereunto if we adde <hi>reſignation,</hi> we doe but ſecure our Petition the more by making Gods will ours, when ours is his; where theſe are exactly performed, and <hi>the name</hi> of Chriſt rightly uſed, there we cannot feare to faile: while it is ſaid <hi>he ſhall give you</hi> what ere you thus <hi>ask</hi> imports as well, he ſhall give it a third perſon, for whom you ask it, as if you did <hi>ask</hi> it for your ſelfe; and indeed if the defect be not on the third perſons part, we ſhall ſooner obtaine what we aske for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then what we aske for our ſelves; becauſe it is a greater charity to pray for others, (and eſpecially for our enemies) then for our ſelves, ſince they may want our help but we can never loſe our owne reward by hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. Becauſe hitherto you have relyed wholly upon me, and have not <hi>asked any thing of my Father in my name,</hi> and indeed having asked of me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="25">25. This Verſe ſhews, what he ſpake now was before his Paſſion, and ſo it was Proverbial, Parabolical, or Enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical unto them, but the time would come, after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, when he for fourty days together would ſpeak plainly, what now they heard of but obſcurely, and that when he was Aſcended, the Holy Ghoſt ſhould come, and by a purer language (by the tongues of fire) ſhould ſpeak all Love, all Light, all Clarity, all Truth unto them, and then they ſhould be capable of much more then now they are: yet there want not, who think Chriſt by this place alludes to his diſplaying of his Fathers Glory in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, where they ſhall ſee all things cleerly as they are, even God himſelf, and ſhall therefore become like God, becauſe they ſhall ſee him face to face, as he is.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. <hi>The day</hi> he means here, is when he ſhall be gone from them, and aſcended up to Heaven, and then, ſaith he, <hi>I do not tell you,</hi> that <hi>I will pray to my Father</hi> in your behalf, firſt, becauſe the holy Ghoſt ſhall come, and by his Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and holy Grace, you ſhall make your own petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo effectually <hi>in my name,</hi> that I ſhall need no more to intercede for you; or becauſe <hi>I</hi> ſhall not need ask as I did, when <hi>I</hi> was upon the Earth, by way of ſuffering for you, but by way of exhibition of what I have ſuffered. Thus one of the Fathers will have it, that Chriſt did onely pray for us on Earth, and that now in Heaven he prays no more, but onely ſhews his ſacred Wounds to his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, though <hi>Cornelius a Lapide</hi> here concludes the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion is, that really and truly he doth there pray for us (as was explicated <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. v. 34. by the ſaid <hi>Cornelius</hi>) but after another manner then here he did, where he both
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:204830:289"/> prayed and ſuffered too, and there he praies without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. So the true Sence of this place is, that he doth not tell them, he will pray for them, though he means to do it, and actually doth it too, as often as deſired, but that, if he did not pray, they ſhould not need his prayer, both becauſe he had ſufficiently purchaſed to them the love of his heavenly Father for his voluntary vouchſafing towards them, and becauſe the holy Gboſt was to finiſh the remainder of our ſalvation by his Supplies and Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines of Holy Graces; and in truth what Chriſt once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for us by his Paſſion, we (loſing the benefit of it by our ſin) are to attribute the recovery thereof to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial act of the holy Ghoſt, not coming once onely down (as to the Apoſtles to confirm them in grace) but millions of times deſcending upon us, by the influence of his holy Gifts, and ſo as often ſaving us (by the recovery of grace) as we make our ſelves guilty of damnation, by relapſe of ſinne.</p>
                           <p n="27">27 See how this Verſe in terms tells them, his <hi>Father</hi> needs not now be prayed unto by him for them, ſince he hath already purchaſed unto them abundantly <hi>his Fathers love,</hi> and ſo made him ſoft to all they can deſire by their own prayer; and the reaſon why he ſo <hi>loves them,</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they loved Jeſus Chriſt, and believed he was his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Fathers Son,</hi> and <hi>come out from him</hi> to them; but if any ask, why God loving us? (as here it is ſaid, he doth) for his Sons ſake? doth not give us all we want without our <hi>asking?</hi> but requires our humble and frequent Prayer. The Reaſons are many; firſt, becauſe it is ſuitable to the Majeſty of God, that all his Creatures do adore him, (and Prayer is the beſt kinde of adoration) next becauſe it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth our totall and neceſſary dependance on him, and our Indigence and his Liberality; Thirdly, the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the things we ask, requires (on our parts) a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent expreſſion of our eſteem thereof, namely, Grace and Glory, not ſo cheap as to be given gratis, however pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed once by Chriſt for us, but we loſing our right to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:204830:290"/> them by ſin, cannot too often petition for their recovery: Laſtly, becauſe by Prayer we exerciſe the nobleſt Acts of Vertue, Faith, Hope, and Charity; the firſt believing God can do all things, the next, hoping he will do all we can deſire; the laſt loving him as a Father, of whom we ask all ſupplyes both for our ſelves and others, as to his own adopted ſons.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. Here our Saviour alludes not onely to his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generation, by his heavenly Fathers commanding him into the Womb of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but to his eternal Generation alſo, whereby he was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, begotten, coeternal, and coequal God <hi>to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father;</hi> ſo that as his coming into this world was his <hi>going</hi> (as we may ſay) <hi>out of his Fathers boſom</hi> to ſeek loſt man, in the Wilderneſs of our Earth; in like manner his leaving this world, was his return with man found (in his ſacred Perſon) <hi>into the ſame paternal boſom</hi> which he came out of.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. This argues he had anſwered now home to all their doubts and interrogatories, by telling them he was the <hi>Son of God who came from him to them,</hi> and was to return from them to him again; this was cleer, naked and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Truth, <hi>no Proverb,</hi> no Riddle, no Parable at all unto them.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:204830:290"/> think, what we wiſh or would have, ſince without <hi>asking,</hi> thou canſt tell us all, and give us more then we can receive; this alone (were there no other) would ſuffice for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficient to prove <hi>thou comeſt ſo from God,</hi> as thou art alſo <hi>God thy ſelf.</hi>

For however all the forty days between the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion were dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by our Saviour to ſettle the Apoſtles (and others) in a right <hi>belief</hi> of Chriſtian Doctrine, yet we never till now did hear the Apoſtles declare the work was done, and that they were ſatisfied and ſettled in their <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſt his being truly the Son of God, which yet they now profeſs in plain tearms, ſaying, <hi>Now thou ſpeakeſt plainly, this we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thou cameſt forth from God,</hi> and art his eternal Son that did become man, wert born, haſt ſuffered, and dyed for our ſins, art riſen from the dead, art to aſcend too unto thy heavenly Father, and art thence to ſend us the holy Ghoſt to be our continual Comforter, Teacher, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</p>

Next by palliating, when we out of <hi>charity</hi> excuſe and make the beſt of mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thirdly, when we doe not onely excuſe them, but actually binde them up, as Chirurgeons doe ſoares to cure them, ſo we doe, when beſides the excuſe we make for our neighbors ſins, we further oblige them by doing good unto them, for the ill they have done to us: and this is an efficacious way indeed to cure their ſoares of ſinne, as well as to cover them, and by binding them to us, we do,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:204830:295"/> as it were, our ſelves take upon us their ſins, and ſo God looking on our good, ſees not their bad, whom we have rendered grateful to him for our ſakes, as Chriſt did ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us all grateful to his heavenly Father, when he took our ſins upon him, and thus <hi>covered</hi> us from his wrath and fury: Laſtly, then we perfectly <hi>cover</hi> our neighbors ſinne, when we doe not onely heale the wound thereof, but heale it ſo cloſe, ſo perfectly, that no ſcar remaines, no memory is in us of the wrong he did us, nor is ſuffered, (if we can help it) to be in any other, of like wrongs done to them.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. By <hi>being hoſpitable without murmuring</hi> he meanes we ſhould be ſo loving to all, as we doe not <hi>murmur</hi> that wee are oppreſſed with the number of the needy, or poore that want our help: and the Apoſtle here reflects parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly on the niggardly mindes of the Inhabitants of <hi>Pontus,</hi> who were extreame narrow in their almes, and would extend the little they gave to very few, whereas he would have charity large, and extended to all.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. This verſe ſhewes how large our <hi>charity</hi> ſhould be, when we are bid to give almes, or doe good to others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion <hi>of grace</hi> that we <hi>receive</hi> from God; and by <hi>grace</hi> is here underſtood, not that which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the ſingle man to God, but that which is gratis gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us, and ſo muſt be gratis communicated to others good, and profit, not to our own end, for it is avarice ſo to give, as we aime at receiving more from others, then we part with from our ſelves: and the very words of the Text are againſt ſelf ends, while they bid us <hi>adminiſter to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which is quite oppoſite to taking for our ſelves: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as Gods <hi>graces</hi> to us are manifold, ſo muſt our <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration</hi> of them to others be, elſe we cannot give <hi>as we receive,</hi> which yet was the firſt rule of this verſe, telling us how to give.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. Here the Apoſtle ſummes up all the kindes of <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> under two, the one in <hi>words,</hi> the other in <hi>deeds,</hi> or the one <hi>preaching,</hi> teaching, exhorting, the other <hi>giving almes,</hi>
                              <pb n="229" facs="tcp:204830:295"/> viſiting the ſick, or doing all other workes of mercy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral; and here we ſee the rule that preachers are tyed unto, of <hi>ſpeaking</hi> not their own but the word of God, or what the holy Ghoſt ſhal dictate, not what humane fanſie ſhal ſuggeſt; and we ſee in the primitive Church the Holy Ghoſt inſpired ſome to <hi>exhort,</hi> others to <hi>ſing hymnes</hi> of praiſe, others to <hi>prophecy,</hi> and each one this to doe, with <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>meekneſs,</hi> not with pride and oſtentation, with <hi>zeale</hi> and <hi>fervour,</hi> not tepidly or dully, according to that of <hi>David, Thy word,</hi> O <hi>Lord,</hi> is <hi>very hot even</hi> as <hi>fire:</hi> and what (by office) the preacher is to doe, (out of charity) the people are to imitate, and as they heare nothing from, the Prieſt, but what belongs to God; ſo all their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſhould be of God and of heavenly things, thereby to inflame one another to acts of Love and praiſe of God. The rule of <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> we ſee, muſt be the ſame with that of <hi>preaching;</hi> if we <hi>give,</hi> it muſt be as <hi>from God,</hi> not from our ſelves, becauſe by giving we intend to do good to others, and ſince all goodneſs comes from God, we muſt be ſure, to give rather in his, then in our own, or any other name: for all <hi>gifts</hi> are originally from God the authour of them all, and if we have any thing to give, it is not our own, but is lent us purpoſely to ſhare part thereof to others, be it a <hi>gift</hi> of nature or of grace: <hi>That in all things,</hi> (which we ſay or doe) <hi>God may be honoured</hi> and glorified, not wee our ſelves magnified, and how <hi>honoured? by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> who firſt taught us this perfection of referring all we ſay or do to <hi>Gods honour</hi> and glory; for before Chriſt came, all was vanity and pride; nothing was done, but for humane ends, for ſelfe reſpects or the like; whereas Chriſtianity teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a quite contrary Doctrine, to referre all to God, and to arrogate nothing at all unto our ſelves; Hence obſerve how beſides <hi>Faith, good works</hi> are neceſſary to ſalvation, which yet the Libertines and Sectaries will not allow of.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. LAſt <hi>Sunday</hi> we were taught it was the proper duty of a Chriſtian to exerciſe continuall Acts <hi>of Hope</hi> betweene the Aſcenſion and the coming of the Holy Ghoſt See conſequently now, how the very firſt words of this dayes Epiſtle ſet us upon the two prime Acts of <hi>Hope, Prudence,</hi> and <hi>watchfull Prayer.</hi> The firſt to ſhew we are not to be fooliſhly beaten off our Principles of <hi>Faith</hi> teaching us by practicall <hi>Prudence</hi> to worke out our ſalvation, in <hi>Hope</hi> we ſhal not labour it in vaine. The ſecond to declare that <hi>Prayer</hi> without <hi>watchfulneſs</hi> is of ſmall or no account at all; ſince therefore, our ſenſes ought to be ſhut up in time of Prayer that the foule (free from diſtraction of all ſenſe) may be like to her ſelfe in the ſtate of ſeparation from the body, ſtill fixt upon Almighty God, as the bleſſed ſpirits of Saints and Angels are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

And ſecondly, becauſe it ſeemes myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done of Holy Church to ſhorten the time of <hi>Hope,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make us ſee, God cannot be long from thoſe that long to be with him, and are in conſtant expectation of his coming; for we ſee that after onely ten dayes <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prayer</hi> (or exerciſe of <hi>Hope</hi>) our Saviour ſent the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to his Apoſtles; not that he had promis'd it ſo ſoone, but that he could not finde in his heart to defer it any longer. And beloved if after the longeſt day of Time we enjoy a bliſsfull eternity, how ſpeedy a reward ſhall we eſteeme it to be of our <hi>Hope</hi> and expectation? in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:204830:296"/> the abundance of the gain will recompence the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt delay thereof; much after that ſort, as our Saviours firſt coming did recompence the four thouſand years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his Birth and Death for the Redemption of the World: when we here the Prophet <hi>Habacuc</hi> c. 2. v. 3. ſay in his name, <hi>I will come and I will not ſtay; nay though I delay my coming, yet I will not tarry.</hi> Why? becauſe when I come, I will reward beyond all expectation.</p>

                           <p n="26">26. NOte here though the Greek Hereticks take hold from hence, to ſay the Holy Ghoſt doth not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> from the Son, but onely <hi>from the Father,</hi> becauſe Chriſt ſaith the latter in expreſs terms; yet the very truth is, that <hi>proceſſion</hi> and <hi>miſſion</hi> in the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons import all one thing, and therefore the Father is never ſaid to be <hi>ſent</hi> at all, wherefore Chriſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:204830:297"/> 
                              <hi>he will ſend the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> it argues his <hi>proceſſion</hi> is equally from both, as his <hi>miſſion</hi> was. <hi>The Paraclete</hi> is as much as to ſay the Comforter, whoſe coming is both to comfort all Chriſtians, and to <hi>give teſtimony</hi> to all the world of that Doctrine which Chriſt had preached; he is called the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> Firſt, becauſe he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Son, who is called the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of his heavenly Father, as alſo <hi>the Way, the Truth,</hi> and <hi>the Life;</hi> Secondly, becauſe his coming made manifeſt the <hi>Truth</hi> of Chriſt his Doctrine, of his being the Meſſias, the Son of God, the Saviour of the World; Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the trueſt and moſt excellent <hi>Spirit,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of whom the Angels, the Souls of men, and the Winds, are but Analogical <hi>Spirits,</hi> as being ſuch onely by participation, whereas the holy Ghoſt is ſo by Eſſence; Fourthly, becauſe for this third Reaſon, he is worthy of all Faith and Credit; Fifthly, becauſe he gives <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the New Teſtament, which was brought us by a Spirit of Liberty and <hi>Truth,</hi> whereas the Old was brought by a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Servitude and Fear, being onely a ſhadow of that <hi>Truth,</hi> which was to come after it; Laſtly, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, becauſe he is the Author of <hi>all Truth,</hi> whence Chriſt ſaid of him, <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. <hi>he ſhall teacb you all truth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="27">27. See the infinite Dignity of the Apoſtolate, and of their Succeſſors, the Prelates of Gods Church, that they are joyned <hi>in teſtimony</hi> of Chriſt his Deity, and of all the other myſteries of Faith, even with the holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and yet the Hereticks ſo undervalue Church Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as if it were onely Humane and Fallible, whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is Divine, becauſe ſupported by Divine Power, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing it ſhould be Infallible; and it is as little derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God his veracity, to ſay that failing man (ſupported by God) cannot erre, as it is to ſay, God cannot erre in that he undertaketh, ſo the Infallibility is radicated in God, however (by his gracious vouchſafing) it is alſo attributed to man, as exerciſing the <hi>miniſtery</hi> of God, not otherwiſe.</p>
                           <p>C. 16. 1. Many take <hi>ſcandal</hi> here in diverſe Sences, but
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:204830:298"/> the beſt and genuine is, that they be not offended at their perſecutors, when they ſhall finde them to oppoſe Gods holy Ordinances, and Miniſters; and that for this reaſon, they do not ſlacken in their Faith or Zeal, as expecting God ſhould (being Good and Goodneſs it ſelf) defend them from evil, while (for his ſake and for his Name) they were doing well, and executing his commands; but ſhould rather remember, he had foretold them theſe things would happen, and that if his heavenly Father permitted him (who was actually God) to be in his own ſacred Perſon abuſed and perſecuted to Death, they ſhould not (being but men) expect to have more regard ſhewed them by Gods enemies, then was ſhewed to God himſelf; but ſhould rather conclude, he ſuffered for them, to give them example to ſuffer for him, and for their own and others ſins beſides.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>Synagogue</hi> imports either the Congregation of the Jewiſh people, or the place wherein they were to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their ceremonial Rites in ſerving God; as now the word Church ſignifies the believers in Chriſt, and the place where Chriſtians aſſemble to attend the Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſo by being <hi>caſt out of the Synagogue,</hi> imports excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, as caſt out of the Place or Society of men ſerving God; for ſo odious were the Apoſtles to the Jews upon the account of Chriſt Jeſus their Maſter, that they were not eſteemed worthy of the name or company of Gods people: and Chriſt comforts them againſt this diſgrace, by making them the Heads of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:204830:298"/> of this perſecution are many, The firſt, the Devils and his Miniſters malice, to ſee Saints prefer Gods Service before the reſpect even to the proud Princes amongſt men; the ſecond, the deſtruction of Idols, by the erecting a worſhip to one onely God; The third, becauſe it was preſumed as falſe as it was new, to preach a crucified man to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God; The fourth, becauſe Chriſtians do not onely beat down the falſe Religions of the Jews and Gentiles, but even reprehend the manners and proceedings of thoſe, who profeſs ſuch falſe worſhip of God, as the Jewes and Gentiles did exhibite; The laſt, becauſe the Devil and his adherents perſwaded the world, that all the miſeries of Famine, Plague, Warre and Death which befell man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, were juſt puniſhments of God inflicted on them, for letting Chriſtian Religion be profeſſed; and this, ſaith he, <hi>they will do to you,</hi> becauſe</p>
                           <p n="3">3. They <hi>neither know my Father nor me,</hi> that is, they will not know either of us; for this is not an excuſing, but an accuſing phraſe of Chriſt: ſo this ignorance was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as extenuating, but as aggravating their fault: and our Saviour animates the Apoſtles to ſuffer theſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scorns with as much neglect, as a Prince would do, who coming ſingly to Town without any viſible attendance or retinue after him, ſhould be refuſed entrance and kept out as a private perſon; for inſtead of being angry, he would comfort himſelf, with the redouble honour it would be to him, to have theſe people let him in with their excuſes and apologies for the affront, as ſoon as his train appeared to teſtifie what he was; and ſuch a Train of holy Saints every Chriſtian ought to believe will follow him, to make the world (with ſhame) cry him mercy, for affronting him, whom God himſelf eſteems and loves.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The reaſon why I <hi>tell you</hi> (or foretel you rather) <hi>theſe things,</hi> is not to diſanimate, but to hearten you to ſuffer them with alacrity, becauſe I ſhall, as ſurely, help you out of theſe bryars, as I have told you, that you ſhould fall into them for my ſake: and if <hi>you remember,</hi> I foretold
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:204830:299"/> you this, you ſhall need no other comfort in your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for you know ſufficiently who I am, your Jeſus, your God, and when I tell you, I ſhall give you the honour of ſuffering for me, be confident, I ſhall not fail to attend you with a Crown of Glory for your Martyrdoms.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THe two firſt Verſes of this Goſpel run wholly upon the <hi>Hope</hi> our Saviour put his Apoſtles in for the coming of the holy Ghoſt: and ſo do fitly now exhort us to the practice of that Vertue, according as we have been taught we muſt, between Aſcenſion and Whitſuntide.

                           <p n="2">2.

How comes this to paſs? but onely as the Royal Prophet ſayes, <hi>Becauſe thou</hi> (eternal God) <hi>haſt ſingularly placed me in Hope,</hi> that is to ſay, haſt made thy ſervants contemn this tempting world, and life it ſelf, the ſweeteſt thing on earth, in expectation of an everlaſting life, or (to uſe thy words divine) meerly <hi>for the Hope of Iſrael.</hi>

                           <p>IF we look back to the three laſt Sundayes-prayers, we ſhall find them all, as it were, preparatives to this, which we now make to day, of <hi>reliſhing thoſe things that are right,</hi> and <hi>rejoycing in the conſolation of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And indeed our B. Saviours whole life and death had no other aim, then by making God man, to winn man into an affection of deity, and of being content to become God, and when by the laſt myſtery of humane redemption (as far as lay on our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours part) his glorious Aſcenſion, we were brought to <hi>devote our wills,</hi> and <hi>our hearts affections ſincerely to the ſervice of Almighty God;</hi> now we are led into that holy School, and unto that heavenly Maſter, where we ſhall be taught, how to ſet our <hi>hearts right</hi> to his heavenly Majeſtie; and this by the <hi>Illumination</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghoſt:</hi> which that we may do the better, ſee how to day we pray, that <hi>in the ſame Spirit we may reliſh thoſe things which are right, and rejoyce in the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> thereof: as if in this School fleſh and bloud were to have no place, which had ſo far, (and ſo long) miſ-led us; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very Apoſtles themſelves, ſo long as they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jeſus Chriſt, as man, they did not <hi>reliſh</hi> the pure <hi>ſervice</hi> of Almighty God, they were not <hi>ſet right</hi> in their <hi>hearts</hi> affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they doted upon fleſh and bloud, and ſo fell into the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours thereof: S. <hi>Peter</hi> of denying Chriſt in his afflictions, S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of doubting of his Reſurrection; but we never heard, that after the coming of the holy Ghoſt, any of the Apoſtles fell into thoſe or any other errours in the rectitude of their <hi>ſervice</hi> towards Almighty God; but were alwayes in the <hi>right,</hi> and took content in nothing that was wrong, or ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from the doctrine of their Maſter our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: And why this? Becauſe the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> who was the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> had poſſeſſed them, and <hi>taught them all truth,</hi> and made them not onely <hi>reliſh</hi> it, but diſreliſh all things that were contrary thereunto.</p>
                           <p>Nor is it without reaſon, that erring man in his moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204830:311"/> prayer ſhould beg the grace of God, to <hi>reliſh what is right;</hi> for we never pleaſe our ſelves with what we do not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> nor do we ever <hi>reliſh</hi> what diſpleaſeth us; whereas to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh what is right,</hi> is to <hi>reliſh</hi> at leaſt what is pleaſing unto God, however it doth oftentimes nor pleaſe our ſelves: and therefore in this grand day, when we are to be weaned from the nurſe of fleſh and bloud, and brought into the ſchool of Spirit, and are to ask our Maſter a boon, now we ſee his hands full of bounty and benevolence, we are taught to beg that we may <hi>reliſh</hi> and <hi>take content in whatſoever is right</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, be it never ſo averſe to our ſelves; becauſe our teeth being ſet on edge with fleſh and bloud, and our mouths quite out of taſte with Spirituall food, nothing is of more import to us, then that we may <hi>reliſh</hi> ſuch meat, as we muſt hereafter live and nouriſh by; <hi>Spirituall conſolations,</hi> not earthly delectations any more, for the firſt, ſet us (and our <hi>hearts</hi> affections) <hi>right</hi> to God, the laſt, draws us headlong to death. Now it will be the leaſt of our cares to day, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt this prayer unto the Epiſtle, ſince this is altogether of the coming down of the holy Ghoſt into the ſchool of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall comfort, where he is to reade his leſſons to mens <hi>hearts,</hi> as this prayer tells us, and as we read <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will write my law in their hearts;</hi> whence it is, holy Church to day takes the Antiphon out of the Epiſtle, rather then out of the Goſpel; and yet rather makes it, then takes it, for though the ſenſe be the ſame, nevertheleſſe the letter is not ſo: which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was myſteriouſly contrived, to ſhew, that as ſoon as the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> came down to teach, the Church was able of her ſelf to reade a leſſon to her children; and immediately we ſee <hi>S. Peter</hi> preached: but indeed as the Goſpels ever tell us the ſtories of our Saviour's life, ſo the Acts of the Apoſtles tell us the hiſtory of <hi>the holy Ghoſt,</hi> firſt that of the fact, when, and how he came, next that of the effect, how prodigiouſly he wrought in the <hi>hearts</hi> of thoſe he did deſcend upon: ſo the Epiſtle being to day out of the Acts of the Apoſtles, is (as the goſpel of the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi>) made the place whence Preachers take their texts, or whereunto at leaſt they drive the deſign of

John tells us (in our Saviours name) <hi>he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me obſerves my words,</hi> which is in effect to ſay, doth <hi>reliſh my words,</hi> doth <hi>reliſh</hi> that which is <hi>right;</hi> for nothing more <hi>right,</hi> then the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> ſince we may take that for verity and rectitude it ſelf, eſpecially being taught us by <hi>the holy Ghoſt,</hi> who, this Goſpel tells, was to come purpoſely to <hi>teach us truth,</hi> the truth of that <hi>word,</hi> by <hi>the Illumination of his holy Spirit,</hi> and was to make the often dead letter of that <hi>word</hi> to be the life of our Souls: for ſo it muſt needs be, when it brings us that <hi>peace</hi> which it promiſeth, namely another manner of <hi>peace then the world giveth,</hi> which is alwayes mixed with war; for whoever <hi>reliſheth</hi> what is <hi>right,</hi> hath a <hi>true peace</hi> within his conſcience, and ſo is at no variance or war at all. In a word, the Goſpel being out of the ſtory of our Saviours Life, tells us the effect of this fact, the fruit we ſhall receive by the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, by <hi>reliſhing thoſe things that are right,</hi> and by <hi>rejoycing in the conſolation of this holy Spirit,</hi> that comes to read leſſons of Divine Love unto our <hi>hearts,</hi> and to wean us from the humane affections we have unto creatures, and conſequently this Goſpel wants no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſting to the Epiſtle and Prayer of this ſolemn day, but makes good ſtill our main deſign in this book.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THat is to ſay, Fifty dayes after the Reſurrection; for as the Chriſtian <hi>Paſche</hi> is a fulfilling that Feaſt of the Jews, which was a figure thereof; ſo likewiſe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204830:313"/> 
                              <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> is a fulfilling of the like figure of the Jewiſh <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> or of the delivery of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> by the like confirmation of the Chriſtian Law, upon the Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> when the holy Ghoſt deſcended purpoſely for that end: But as the Jewiſh <hi>Paſche</hi> was on Saturday, (which was their Sabbath) ſo was the ſeventh Saturday after, their <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and the Chriſtian <hi>Paſche</hi> being the day after (which was Sunday) makes the ſeventh Sunday following to be the Chriſtian <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> both to ſhew Chriſt did abrogate the Jewiſh <hi>Sabbath,</hi> by riſing on <hi>Sunday,</hi> and the Jewiſh <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt,</hi> by ſending the holy Ghoſt the ſeventh <hi>Sunday</hi> after, which proves that the Chriſtian Religion, as it was ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the Jewiſh, ſo it did abrogate the ſame. By thoſe that were here, (in the place of the laſt Supper) <hi>aſſembled,</hi> we are not to underſtand onely the Twelve Apoſtles but alſo the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin Mary,</hi> and all the reſt of the Diſciples and friends of Chriſt, then in Jeruſalem, to the number of about one hundred and twenty, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> recounts, and S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> gives a very pious reaſon for this number, ſaying, <q>What Chriſt did promiſe onely to his twelve Apoſtles, he performs into a ten-fold multiplyed number; for ten times twelve make juſt one hundred and twenty;</q> ſo Chriſt to ſhew his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality made his promiſe good ten times over; and indeed it is uſuall in Almighty God to better the expectation of his creatures.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The myſtery of this noiſe or <hi>ſound</hi> was, that thereby the Jews might come together out of curioſity to ſee what the matter was, when they heard a ſudden clap like thunder, juſt over the place where the Apoſtles were aſſembled; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to raiſe up the hearts of thoſe within the place, to heaven, expecting hereupon ſomething of conſequence to follow: it was <hi>ſudden</hi> for two reaſons, Firſt to ſhew it to be a voluntary and free gift of grace, ſuch as could not be merited by any our previous preparation thereunto: Secondly, to ſhew the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of that holy grace, working to all purpoſes in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as we ſee it did in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> both inſtantaneouſly converted from notorious ſinners, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:204830:313"/> made eminent Saints: whence S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayes truly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting upon the firſt of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> 
                              <q>The grace of the holy Ghoſt brooks no delayings:</q> This <hi>ſudden ſound</hi> came <hi>from heaven,</hi> to ſhew that as Gods throne was there, ſo he came by his holy grace to call and to carry the Apoſtles, and all good Chriſtians thither: it came like a huge <hi>high wind,</hi> to ſhew the effects it was to have, when the voices of thoſe it ſell upon were heard <hi>all the world over, from one end to the other,</hi> as was prophetically foretold by holy <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18. Now we are to note, the holy Ghoſt hath appeared ſeverall times in ſeverall wayes, as firſt like a Pigeon or <hi>Dove</hi> upon Chriſt baptized, to ſhew the columbine ſimplicity of grace and good works: next like a <hi>Cloud</hi> in the Transfiguration, to ſhew the fertility of Chriſtian Doctrine, falling like a fruitfull rain upon the barren ſouls of men, and covering them from the nocive ſinne of luſtfull deſires. Thirdly like a <hi>Breath,</hi> to ſhew the manner of Chriſtian converſion was to be by aſpiration, or <hi>breathing</hi> of the holy Ghoſt upon our hearts, and giving us thence a ſpirituall life; and this was when at the laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Chriſt <hi>breathing</hi> upon his Apoſtles ſaid, <hi>Receive ye the holy Ghoſt, to remiſſion of ſinnes: Joh.</hi> 20.22. Fourthly (as here) both like <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>wind;</hi> the firſt to ſhew the holy Ghoſt did inflame the hearts of men to the love of God, and burn up in them all the ſtubble of their terrene affections; the laſt, to ſhew the efficacy that the Apoſtles preaching ſhould have to convert all the world; and like a whirl-wind blow down the reſiſtance of Princes and Potentates, as ſo many Towers ſtanding in their way, and alſo blow all infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, all hereſie, all ſects and ſchiſms quite away as ſo much chaff and droſſe in reſpect of ſolid doctrine: not that there was a reall <hi>wind,</hi> but yet a reall <hi>ſound,</hi> or rather an effect as of a reall wind, for had the wind been reall, (being ſo great) it had overthrown the houſe, and done miſchief to thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and indeed the Text ſaith, it was a <hi>noiſe, like the coming of a high winde:</hi> nor was it marvell, God could produce a <hi>ſound</hi> without a <hi>winde</hi> for as the <hi>fiery tongues</hi> were not reall <hi>tongues.</hi> but onely ſimilitudes thereof, ſo was this noiſe no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204830:314"/> 
                              <hi>wind,</hi> but onely a likeneſſe of it. The whole houſe was filled with this <hi>noiſe,</hi> to ſhew all their hearts who were within, <hi>ſhould be filled with the Holy Ghost;</hi> for thus the Text affirms immediately, ſaying, verſ. 4. <hi>and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Note; it is ſaid they were <hi>Sitting;</hi> both to ſhew the reſt and quiet Gods holy Spirit bringeth with it, and to ſhew that prayer of expectation (and ſuch this was) is perhaps beſt, when it is performed <hi>ſitting:</hi> thus S. <hi>Bernard</hi> (a great Saint) was noted to proceed in his deepeſt meditations.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. By <hi>parted tongues</hi> is here underſtood tongues divided amongſt many, not in themſelues, as commonly Painters make them, thinking thereby to expreſſe the activity of fire, riſing up in many-pointed flames: but the reaſons why the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> would have the forme of <hi>a tongue</hi> to declare his coming, are many: Firſt, becauſe the Apoſtles were by this coming confirmed to be the Preachers of the Goſpel; and the proper inſtrument of a Preacher is his <hi>tongue.</hi> So the <hi>gift of tongues</hi> was firſt expreſſed by the ſpecies of <hi>a tongue:</hi> (where we are to note, this gift includes three properties, the firſt the knowledge of languages; the next, the true ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the words of different languages; the third, a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility of tongue adapted to the ſeveral articulations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ſeveral Languages, and conſequently a prudence to uſe all theſe in a right way) The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe <hi>a tongue</hi> hath a great affinity with a word; as therefore <hi>the Holy Ghoſt</hi> was the Spirit of <hi>the VVord,</hi> ſo he came in the ſpecies of a <hi>Tongue:</hi> and as by the word of the mind is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the voyce of the tongue; ſo from the <hi>Divine word</hi> did proceed the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> whence the Apoſtle 1 Cor. 12. verſ. 3. ſayes, <hi>no man can ſay Jeſus, but in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The third, as the tongue diſtinguiſheth taſtes, ſo doth the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> truths from falſhoods, heavenly from earthly things; inſomuch, that St <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>The Animal man doth not perceive the things of the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. Laſtly, becauſe the tongue is both the beſt and worſt inſtrument of man, Proverb. 12. <hi>Death and life are in the hand of the Tongue:</hi> &amp; Prov. 16. <hi>It is in man to prepare his heart, but the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204830:314"/> of the tongue is from our Lord;</hi> wherefore there was great reaſon to have <hi>the gift of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to tame, rule, and ſanctifie the <hi>tongues</hi> of men. As for the <hi>tongues</hi> themſelves, whether they were true <hi>fire,</hi> or true <hi>tongues,</hi> is queſtioned; yet reſolved beſt, that they were not truly <hi>fire</hi> but only fiery forms, like unto <hi>tongues;</hi> as ſome ayr condenſed and made into that form, and illuminated ſo as to ſeem <hi>fire,</hi> but not to burn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was to ſet upon <hi>the heads</hi> of thoſe it fell upon. Of their pyramidal form we give many reaſons: Firſt, to ſhew the Spirit of God only penetrates all deep and hard myſteries. Secondly, to ſhew it penetrated the very <hi>hearts</hi> of thoſe it fell upon, and made them cordially love Almighty God. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it made them aſpire from earth as high as heaven. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the very <hi>tongues</hi> of thoſe who had this gift ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the hearts of men to their converſion. Laſtly, to ſhew it ſhould give them the diſcretion of ſpirits, that had this gift, to diſtinguiſh betwixt good and bad inſpirations in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or in thoſe they were to direct ſpiritually. And theſe <hi>tongues</hi> were rather <hi>fiery,</hi> then of any other kind, to ſhew, God is all a flame of Love, as Deut. 4.24. <hi>Thy God, O Iſrael, is a conſuming fire.</hi> And therefore as the Law of Moyſes (ſhewing Gods Will) was given with the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Thunder and Lightening; ſo the Law of Chriſt now was to be confirmed by <hi>the holy Ghoſt</hi> with like ſignes, to ſhew it was the Will of the ſame God, abrogating the former, and conſtituting this new Law. Secondly, as all the old Prophets were authorized by circumſtance of fire: Iſaias his lips being touched with a coal <hi>of fire,</hi> became as we read, Chap. 6 ver. 6. <hi>like fire;</hi> and his words ſeemed all <hi>fiery</hi> too: and Elias being carried up in <hi>a fiery</hi> Chariot into heaven, 4 Reg. 2.11. and of Hieremias it is ſaid, from above he ſent <hi>fire</hi> into mens bones, and thereby inſtructed them, Thren. 2. v. 13. and Ezechiel foretelling of Chriſt his Chariot ſupported by four Cherubims, of whom he ſayes, Chap. 1. v. 13. <hi>Their looks were like fire coales:</hi> all which were but types of the more univocal <hi>fire,</hi> that did accompany the election, confirmation, and converſation of the Apoſtles,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:204830:315"/> true Prophets of the new law, &amp; foretellers of heavenly things. Thirdly, to ſhew Chriſt his law was a law of love, of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of coeleſtiall <hi>fire:</hi> Fourthly, to ſhew the effect of this love was to produce the <hi>fire</hi> of love divine in all Chriſtian ſouls: Fifthly, to ſhew the ſpirit of God was ſearching as <hi>fire,</hi> the moſt ſubtle worker, and penetratour that is in nature. The reaſon why theſe <hi>fiery tongues</hi> were ſaid to ſit in the ſingular number, not plurall, upon the Apoſtles, was to ſhew that though the <hi>tongues</hi> were (and muſt be) many, for each to have one, yet the <hi>Spirit</hi> giving them was one, and not many, namely one onely God. And this <hi>Spirit</hi> was rather expreſſed <hi>ſetting</hi> then otherwiſe, to ſhew the conſtancy of Gods holy grace and gifts in thoſe he pleaſeth to beſtow his ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours on, and their eaſe and reſt in the poſſeſſion of that <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> as alſo, that the holy Ghoſt was to reſt in the hearts of the Faithfull to the worlds end.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>They were all repleniſhed;</hi> whereas before they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the grace of God, now they had the plenitude thereof, not all alike, but ſome more, ſome leſſe, according as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to their callings: No marvell then, if the Apoſtles being full of grace and the gift of tongues, they could not contain themſelves, but ſay <hi>The Things which we have ſeen and heard, we cannot but ſpeak:</hi> nay, ſo much they ſpake, that ſome believed they were <hi>drunk with new wine;</hi> and ſo it was indeed with the wine of the heavenly grape, the holy Ghoſt, not otherwiſe; and as they were inforced to ſpeak the praiſes of God by the irrefragable impulſe of this holy Spirit, ſo they ſpake to all purpoſes, that is, to the capacity and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of all hearers, of what nation ſoever, for they ſpake all kind of languages or tongues: which ſome will underſtand, as if each Apoſtle ſpeaking a ſeverall language, among them all they had all languages: others conceive that they ſpeaking onely in their own Syro-Hebraean tongue, all the ſeveral nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons underſtood them, as if their languages had been various, (as in this manner S. <hi>Vincentius Ferrerius</hi> preaching in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh was underſtood by ſeverall nations, as Italians, French, Flemiſh, Engliſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> each conceiving they heard him in their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:204830:315"/> native tongue,) grounded in theſe words following, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>We hear them ſpeaking in our tongues.</hi> But the true ſenſe is, they did really and truly ſpeak (upon occaſion) all languages, by the <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>Tongues</hi> beſtowed on them: firſt, becauſe ſo ſayes the text, <hi>they ſpake in divers tongues.</hi> Secondly, becauſe the miracle had been elſe wrought in the hearers, not in the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. Thirdly, the <hi>gift</hi> or reall diverſity of <hi>tongues</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied by <hi>Iſaias</hi> chap. 28. <hi>In other tongues, and in other lips will I ſpeak unto this people:</hi> therefore it muſt be fulfilled, as was affirmed ſo to be by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.21. <hi>I give my God thanks, that I ſpeak with the tongue of you all.</hi> Beſides Chriſt in S. <hi>Mark cap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 17. did promiſe this <hi>gift,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>They ſhall ſpeak with new tongues.</hi> Fourthly, becauſe ſo the Church hath ever taught us. Fifthly, elſe many miracles muſt concurre to one work, as in the ſpeaker and the hearer too. Though this doth not deny, but the Apoſtles might as well by one language ſpeak intelligibly to all hearers of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nations, as S. <hi>Vincentius</hi> did: To conclude, as they were ſent to all nations, ſo aſſuredly they had the <hi>gift</hi> of all <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,</hi> as alſo the B. Virgin, S. <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and all the one hundred and twenty then preſent had the ſame <hi>gift:</hi> yet ſo as they did not uſe it, but as the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> inſpired them to ſpeak upon juſt occaſions; and then in ſuch manner as was moſt excellent, and beſt ſuiting to all purpoſes, becauſe <hi>the works of God are ever perfect, Deut.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>.4. and this was ſuch: ſo that it is credible, they never made uſe of this <hi>gift,</hi> but to Gods honour and glory, at leaſt they ever ſurely aimed thereat, how be it as humane creatures they might erre in ſome circumſtantials of their actions, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ſome exceſſes in that kind, eſpecially in women ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Churches by this <hi>gift of tongues.</hi>

THis <hi>anſwer</hi> of our Saviour was to the interrogatory of the Apoſtle Judas Thaddaeus, the brother to St. James the leſſer, demanding ver. 22. why Chriſt was pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf to the Apoſtles onely, and not to the whole world; becauſe he ſaid to them, <hi>The world doth not ſee me, but ye ſee me;</hi> which though ſpoken in the preſent tenſe, was meant in the future, alluding to what the Apoſtles did after ſee in him, namely his Paſſion, Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion: And the reaſon why he did manifeſt himſelf to them and not to the world, was as St. Auſtin obſerves, becauſe they did <hi>love</hi> him, but the world did not ſo: and this I premiſe to ſhew, that what followes here, alludes to this, as to the effects which the <hi>love</hi> of God procures in thoſe that do truly <hi>love</hi> him: as this Goſpel begins to day with an effect of <hi>love, keeping Gods</hi> commandements, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as here it lyes in this Goſpel, is rather an abſolute aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then a relative <hi>anſwer</hi> to a queſtion; and yet in truth it was the <hi>anſwer</hi> that Chriſt gave to the queſtion of St. Jude, as above in the immediate verſe before, whereunto Jeſus <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,</hi> ſaying, <hi>If any love me, he will keep my word;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, as I loving my Father, <hi>keep his command,</hi> of coming into this world to manifeſt his glory to you that love him, (and by you to all the world) though not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to them all, as I mean to do to you: So do not think that after my Reſurrection, when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhall come down and inflame the hearts of many Infidels and Gentiles with the <hi>love</hi> of God, that then I ſhall onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt my ſelf to you alone that are my Apoſtles, and now
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:204830:318"/> are onely thoſe that <hi>love</hi> me; no, no, then I ſhall be ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to others, that they will <hi>love</hi> me as you do; and this ſhall be the teſtimony that I give you thereof, that their <hi>love</hi> ſhall be ſuch, as by vertue thereof they will <hi>keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> my words will be to them dear, as now they are to you: and as you receiving the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> receive with him both my Self and my Father, (for we three are all one inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Subſtance or Eſſence however diſtinct and ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) juſt ſo ſhall the whole Bleſſed and undivided Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, enter into the hearts of all that <hi>love me, and keep my Commandments</hi> or <hi>my word:</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to them as well as to you ſhall I be then manifeſted. And in this ſenſe you ſee this verſe is an exact <hi>anſwer</hi> to the queſtion of S. Jude, which otherwiſe ſeems a meer diſparate, or an incongruous reply to that interrogatory. And from hence we may perceive how hard it is to underſtand the true ſenſe of almoſt any part of holy Writ, unleſſe we ſee clearly the connexion it hath to precedent or conſequent parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: ſo what S. Jude meant of his perſonal or viſible manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation to theſe few onely that were eye-witneſſes of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he means of his ſpiritual or inviſible beeing made known to all the world by his <hi>Faith,</hi> and doctrine received and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced amongſt them through the preaching of the Apoſtles and their Succeſſours. But we muſt note, that <hi>coming</hi> or <hi>going</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (who is at all times in all places by reaſon of his immenſity) is not to be underſtood, as if he did <hi>come</hi> or <hi>go</hi> from one place to another; but he therefore is ſaid to <hi>come</hi> or <hi>go,</hi> becauſe he operates, or operates not, at all times, or in all places alike: for his operation is his <hi>coming,</hi> and ſo every new inſpiration of grace we have, is as if God made a new viſite unto us, within the temple of our ſoules, where he delights to be: and though he be never ſeparated from us locally, (ſince he fills all place) yet he is ſaid to come a new into our hearts, every time we produce or exerciſe a new act of <hi>love</hi> unto him; and if we continue one Act all our lives, then he doth all that time operate within us, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is ſaid not only to <hi>come</hi> unto us, but even <hi>to live with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204830:319"/> us,</hi> to <hi>dwell</hi> indeed <hi>within us:</hi> which happineſſe we cannot receive from any one ſingle Perſon of the Bleſſed Trinity, but we muſt own it to them All three, ſince where one Perſon is, of neceſſity there all the three Divine Perſons are alſo, be it by preſence, or by operation.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. Here we ſee clearly the cauſe of our well doing or <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods commands,</hi> is our <hi>loving God,</hi> and conſequently the cauſe of our not doing well, is our <hi>not loving him;</hi> to which purpoſe St. <hi>Gregory</hi> hom. 30. ſayes excellently well: To know whether we love God or not, ask our Tongues if they ſpeak well of him, ask our ſouls if they imploy their thoughts upon him, ask our lives if our actions be directed to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, if they be doing what he hath commanded, or avoiding what he hath forbidden. When he ſayes, <hi>The word he ſpeaks is not his,</hi> the meaning is, 'tis not onely <hi>his,</hi> but alſo <hi>his Fathers,</hi> becauſe himſelf is the <hi>word</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> and conſequently as his nature is common with him and his Father, ſo is his operation too; wherefore what he ſayes to us, his <hi>Father</hi> ſayes to him, becauſe all he is himſelf, is to be <hi>his Fathers word.</hi>

Secondly, <hi>in his name</hi> imports in vertue of his merits deſerving for us the happineſſe of this comfortable miſſion, or miſſive comforter. Thirdly, <hi>in his name</hi> is as much as to ſay, in his place, to ſupply his viſible preſence by an inviſible comfort equal thereunto, that <hi>he</hi> may finiſh the work of humane ſalvation, which Chriſt began: and hence it followes, <hi>he ſhall teach you all things,</hi> namely to underſtand what Jeſus told you, and what he will have you further to know, for eſtabliſhing his Church over all the world; and <hi>he ſhall ſuggeſt and prompt to you all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I ſhall ſay.</hi> This place is liable to ſeveral ſenſes; as whether the holy Spirit <hi>ſhall ſuggeſt</hi> more unto them (for government of the Church) then Chriſt told them, becauſe he ſpake much, which they could not then underſtand; or whether his <hi>ſuggeſtion</hi> ſhall onely be an expoſition of what they heard before, and were not able to penetrate the bottome of it: but truly the laſt ſenſe ſeemes moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, becauſe of that which followes, namely his <hi>ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting what Chriſt ſhall ſay;</hi> (what he hath unintelligibly already <hi>ſaid,</hi> and ſhall afterwards intelligibly by the Holy Ghoſt <hi>ſay</hi> unto them;) yet this ſenſe may be verified, though we do not take <hi>ſuggeſtion</hi> to be as a help to underſtanding, but to memory, as generally the Expoſitours conceive of it; as if the <hi>ſuggeſtion</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> were a renewing the memory of the Apoſtles towards calling to mind, and (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on recalling) better underſtanding the meaning of what Chriſt had ſaid, then they did when they heard him ſpeak, what was now revived in their memory by the prompting or <hi>ſuggeſtion</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> But ſince in other places the Expoſitours have declared, Chriſt did not tell the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles all that, which he meant they ſhould do by the inſtinct
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:204830:320"/> of the <hi>Holy Gboſt,</hi> eſpecially for framing and maintaining the Hierarchy of the Church, nor for expounding the myſteries of Faith; therefore if we take here this <hi>ſuggeſtion</hi> in a larger ſenſe then generally Expoſitours do, we ſhall not erre; as, if we extend it to the <hi>holy Ghoſt prompting</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, what our Saviour ſhall ſay to him, and by him to them, now that he is in heaven: for as Chriſt ſayes <hi>his doctrine</hi> is <hi>not his own,</hi> but his heavenly <hi>Fathers,</hi> ſo it is certain the <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi> of the holy Ghoſt are not his own, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> his doctrine, whether delivered before by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo renewed in the memory of the Apoſtles by the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> (as all Expoſitours allow) or whether now onely ſpoken immediately to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> by Chriſt, and by mediation of that holy Spirit to us: for aſſuredly there are many things eſpecially concerning government of the holy Church ſuggeſted by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to the now preſent Governours thereof, which were not ſpoken by Chriſt to his Apoſtles.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. By <hi>Chriſt his peace,</hi> is here meant that which St. Paul Philip. 4. told us, <hi>did exceed all humane ſenſe;</hi> and this he calls <hi>his,</hi> ſo peculiarly, as indeed it can be properly no bodies elſe, but his own; ſince he hath purchaſed it for us, by his having ended all our war with ſin, death, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, all ſuch war, as can indanger us; (if our ſelves be not cowards and ceaſe to fight) for this aſſurance we have, as long as we fight we conquer, and in conquering poſſeſſe <hi>that peace,</hi> which by the Battel of temptation, the devill ſought to wreſt away from us; that ſweetneſſe, that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of ſoul, which a good conſcience bringeth with it at all times, and to all perſons whatſoever. This is the <hi>peace</hi> Chriſt gave, and this <hi>he gives not as the world gives peace,</hi> which is rather perturbation; for the more we have of worldly peace and eaſe, the leſſe we have of true tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of mind, which is then moſt perfect, when we are moſt at ſtrife with the world, and other enemies to <hi>Chriſtian peace.</hi> St. Auguſtine hath an excellent ſaying to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: <q>
                                 <hi>He cannot</hi> be at <hi>peace</hi> with Chriſt, who hath any
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:204830:320"/> contention with a Chriſtian who is a member of him.</q> But the moſt genuine ſenſe of this place is, that he gave the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>his own peace,</hi> immunity from all ſin, which onely can be the breach of <hi>peace</hi> with God; And therefore he cloſed this verſe with theſe words, <hi>let not your heart be troubled</hi> at my going from you, the preſence of my <hi>peace</hi> ſhall ſupply for the abſence of my perſon.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. <hi>You have heard I ſay to you, I go,</hi> (when I dye) <hi>and come,</hi> (when I riſe again) and when I am ſo <hi>come</hi> back (to take away your grief for my departure by death) if then <hi>you did love me,</hi> you would rejoyce at my leaving you again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I then am <hi>to go,</hi> (not to dye any more, but) to live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with <hi>my Father</hi> in glory, and to ſhare out part of that glory to you alſo: But he gives another, and a deeper reaſon, why they ſhould (if they did love him) rejoyce at his <hi>going to his Father,</hi> namely, becauſe <hi>his Father is greater then he,</hi> can protect him and his friends from all thoſe perſecutions, which the Jews raiſed againſt him and them; not but that he could have protected them himſelf from theſe, but this he ſayes, as accommodating his ſpeech to them, to make it an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they themſelves ſhould yeeld unto, as convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to thoſe that did <hi>love</hi> him. And though from theſe very words the Arrian hereſie took faſteſt root, denying the Deity of Chriſt, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>his Father is greater then he;</hi> yet without all reaſon, for no ſuch thing followes; ſince his meaning was in this place, that <hi>his Father,</hi> as God, <hi>was greater then he,</hi> as man, (for ſo he was even <hi>leſſe then Angels</hi>) being it was onely as man that he <hi>went</hi> to his Father, who, as God, was never from him, nor could be: And ſo Chriſt as God, was greater then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as man; much more then <hi>was his Father greater then he</hi> in that true ſenſe he ſpake this in: though according to humane ſenſe and reaſon, the <hi>Father,</hi> as God, is alſo greater then the Son as God, becauſe he is the <hi>origin</hi> of the Son, or his <hi>beginning,</hi> how ever the Son be equall to him in eſſence and power; ſo it is a <hi>majority</hi> in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding at leaſt, though not in the thing underſtood.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:204830:321"/> But the Arrian hereſie was grounded on a miſtake of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy between divine and humane generation: for though amongſt men the Father is many wayes better and greater then the Son, as for example, becauſe he is older then the Son, and was in beeing before him; again, becauſe he (a tall Father) begetteth at firſt, a little ſon; beſides, his Son is a thing numerically, nay ſubſtantially diſtinct from the father; laſtly, becauſe the Father had liberty and could have choſen, whether or no he would have begotten a Son: yet in God all is quite otherwiſe; for there is no priority nor poſteriori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no majority nor minority, no numerical nor ſubſtantial difference in Deity between the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> though there be a numerical difference in their perſonalities; neither is there any liberty, but an abſolute neceſſity of the Sons ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and of his being coaeval, coequal, and ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="29">29. The <hi>belief</hi> he here ayms to gain is that of his Deity, and of his voluntary (not coacted, or inforced) death, for the ſins of the people: ſo that which he foretold here was his Death, his Reſurrection, his Aſcenſion, and his ſending the holy Ghoſt unto them after he was aſcended, that when they ſee all things happen, (as he had told them) they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <hi>believe</hi> he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the God-man that came to redeem and ſave the world.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. So after he had thus prepared them for all events, he told them, he would not <hi>ſay much more unto them,</hi> becauſe the devil (whom he calls <hi>the prince of this world) cometh,</hi> (was at hand in his miniſters the Jews) to perſecute him to death: and he therefore calls him <hi>prince of the world,</hi> becauſe by ſin the world inſlaves it ſelf unto him; he is come to take me, and yet <hi>he hath no power in me,</hi> becauſe I have no ſin to give him the leaſt right over me; but I freely give my ſelf up to his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny over me, that I may redeem the world from his uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and Tyranny over them; nay the very injuſtice he doth to me, ſhall confiſcate all the right he hath over others.</p>
                           <p n="31">
                              <pb n="23" facs="tcp:204830:321"/>31. That is, <hi>to ſhew the world that I love my Father, and do as he commanded me,</hi> therefore I dye, and give my ſelf into the hands of my enemies. Hence it is asked, how it can be true which is ſaid of him by Iſaias 53. <hi>he was offered</hi> (for ſin) <hi>becauſe himſelf was ſo pleaſed;</hi> ſince it was not by his choice, but by his <hi>Fathers command,</hi> that he did ſuffer, inſomuch that if he had not ſuffered, he had ſinned in an act of diſobedience? and though pure man may chooſe to do or not to do as he is bid, and ſo truly doth either, yet Chriſt who was God as well as man, could not chooſe, and ſo ſeems inforced: for if man in him had ſinned (by reaſon his two Natures made but one Perſon, and actions are of perſons not of natures) then God had ſinned as well as man, becauſe God and man were in Chriſt but one perſon. But we muſt conceive in one perſon of Chriſt there were two ſtates or conditions, the one of a viatour, or <hi>paſſenger;</hi> the other of a comprehenſour, of one impatriated, or in glory: that is to ſay, the one of a traveller, of a man baniſhed from home, or in his journey home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; the other of one poſſeſſed of his own, reſtored from baniſhment, arrived at his journies end, and beeing at his reſt: So Chriſt, as a viatour or traveller had liberty of choiſe to ſuffer or not to ſuffer; though as he was (by his hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical union to the word, and by his Beatifical Viſion conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to that union rendring him in glory) in the ſtate of thoſe who are finally bleſſed, he had no choyce, but did all things as neceſſarily as the Bleſſed do in heaven, who cannot chooſe to do otherwiſe, then love and obey God in all things that they do: and yet even ſo they may be ſaid to love God freely too, becauſe they are underſtanding creatures, and free will is radicated in the underſtanding, for nothing that hath not reaſon hath will, and the root of willing is the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; therefore though the will be neceſſitated, upon ſuppoſition that the ſoul is at home or in glory, and cannot chooſe but love God as long as ſhe ſees him, yet that love is radically free, becauſe it was a free act of the ſoul departing from the ſtate of a viatour, and ſo retains the nature of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as being rather a continued then a new act of free-will.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:204830:322"/> And in this ſenſe Chriſt (even as in his ſtate of bliſſe) might be ſaid here freely to ſuffer, becauſe as he was at the ſame time a viatour, he did ſuffer freely, and uncoacted; for the neceſſary continuation is rather a reward of the former act, then any new act at all: beſides this neceſſity is rather extrinſecal to the act, as being radicated in the immutability of the object, and of the glory repreſenting to the ſight that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, then intrinſecal thereunto, otherwiſe then as continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an act is intrinſecal unto it ſelf. For as the Act of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſouls is neceſſarily unalterable, (like thoſe of Angels) ſo the laſt Act they had, when they were united to their bodies remains eternally, and is not unproperly ſaid to be the ſame Act continued for all eternity; and therefore free for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at firſt freely produced, when the ſoul was in ſtate of a viatour, and out of that iſſued into the better ſtate of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriated ſpirit: nay though Purgatory intervene, yet that remora alters not the nature or freedome of the Act, becauſe ſoules there retain their love to God, wherewith they dyed, however they ſuffer for former infirmities of their life paſt.</p>

WHat may be to our ſpecial and preſent uſe in this Goſpel is, to obſerve that Holy Church culls it out as the moſt proper to the now flowing Feaſt of Pentecoſt, though ſpoken by our Saviour to his Diſciples before his Pasſion, (as appears ver. 29. above) but with intention they ſhould then make memory and uſe thereof, when they had received <hi>the holy Ghoſt;</hi> as conſequently we muſt do at the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Feſtivity. The main ſcope of this Goſpel is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting us to <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>love;</hi> and telling us the ſign of true love is <hi>to keep the word of God,</hi> and that the effect of this love will be to draw down into our ſoules the <hi>Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> as delighting to live in the <hi>hearts</hi> of thoſe who love the Son of God, and ſhew their love by <hi>keeping his holy word.</hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:204830:322"/> profitable to be reflected on; which is that our Saviour ſeems here only to relate, or ſpeak, (as v. 25. &amp; 26.) and to leave it to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to <hi>ſuggeſt and teach</hi> the true meaning of what he ſaid; as if it were a ſpeech too profound for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to dive into, without the help of the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> If then our B. Lord, the wiſdome of his eternal Father, and conſequently the beſt ſpokes-man in the world, would not (what ere he could) ſpeak ſo plain to his Apoſtles themſelves, as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by them before the coming of the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate his meaning, how abſurdly ſhall it be done in thoſe that are ignorant Lay-men, to dare to underſtand or interpret holy writ?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Hence we muſt infer that we are bound, in the firſt place, to believe <hi>the holy Ghoſt</hi> to be coequal God with the Father, and the Son who ſent him ſince none but God can be of Gods counſel, and tell men the meaning of Gods holy word. Again, we muſt infer that it is the love of God, who now muſt teach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>NOw the myſteries of our Redemption are compleat, by the contribution of all the Three divine perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity thereunto; as of the <hi>Father</hi> ſending his only Son to dye for us; of the <hi>Son</hi> coming and actually dying for our ſins; and of the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> deſcending and ſanctifying us with his holy grace, to make us ſin no more; it is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, we ſhould cloſe up the ſaid myſteries with a peculiar feaſt of the ſame Bleſſed Trinity, and ſo put a glorious crown upon the work of our Redemption; while we begin to work out our ſalvation from the firſt root thereof, which is our Faith in the moſt Bleſſed and undivided <hi>Trinity:</hi> a myſtery ſo unheard of before Chriſt had taught it to the world, that even to this day it is the hardeſt thing which can be told to men, and the thing which the bleſſed Angels that behold it, do not comprehend; how the Divine Nature can be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Trine, which nevertheleſſe is eſſentially but One. In admiration whereof St. Paul, in this dayes Epiſtle, breaks out into a Triple Trinity of his expreſſing this Triunity, ſaying, <hi>O depth of the Riches! of the wiſdome! and of the knowledge of God!</hi> Loe the firſt: <hi>Who ever knew the ſenſe of our Lord?</hi> or <hi>who was ever of his Counſel?</hi> or <hi>who gave firſt unto him, and it ſhall be reſtored again?</hi> Loe the ſecond; <hi>For of God, by God, and in God are all things:</hi> Loe the laſt of his Triple expreſſions; alluding all of them to the Bleſſed Trinity, as by the Expoſitours of this Epiſtle we ſhall find, and conſequently muſt acknowledge it to be included in the Prayer above; As alſo the Goſpel is, expreſſing how our B. Lord ſent his miſſion of Apoſtles with commiſſion to

                              <hi>Baptize,</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> all the world the myſtery of this Bleſſed Trinity, <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So we have this day the beſt of harmonies in the myſtical muſick of this book, while we find all three parts of holy Churches ſervice to day ſo neatly woven into one; the Epiſtle, Goſpel, and Prayer all ſinging forth the praiſes of the moſt Bleſſed and undivided <hi>Trinity, Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> three Divine Perſons, and one onely God. Hitherto the myſteries of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption were all upon Gods tranſient works about his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; now we come to the immanent actions of the Sacred Deity within its own Eſſence: and theſe are operations ſo hidden from created knowledge, as our beſt comportment will be with St. <hi>Paul</hi> rather to admire then ſearch into them: ſuffice it, Chriſt who hath revealed this myſtery, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf to be God by his works amongſt men; and being God muſt needs be eſſential verity, and ſo can neither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, nor deceive, even when we take him upon greateſt truſt. We muſt therefore follow him, as Schollers do their maſters, before they underſtand them; and we ſhall find (as children do) our underſtandings bettered by giving truſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this heavenly Maſter; and at the latter day we ſhall with the Bleſſed in heaven <hi>ſee, as we have heard of this prodigious myſtery;</hi> that is, we ſhall with our intellectual eyes behold the <hi>Triunity</hi> thereof, which yet while we behold we cannot comprehend. And indeed it is admirable to ſee how in the dark of this profound myſtery we find light to <hi>illuminate</hi> the whole world, whileſt the light of Faith breakes out of this bleſſed cloud; ſince in believing this one thing, which we know not, we are taught to know almoſt all things elſe that we believe: as the Apoſtles in vertue of this belief were bid immediately to <hi>Go and teach all nations,</hi> that is, they were to <hi>go</hi> in the light of this Faith, and <hi>teach</hi> all the world both it and all things elſe belonging to their ſoules ſalvation. And how to teach them? by firſt <hi>Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> By the name we have the unity, by the perſons the Trinity of God taught unto us; and that teacheth us all the reſt, which we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:204830:324"/> are implicitely told in the cloſe of this dayes prayer, when we beg a <hi>firmneſſe in the Faith</hi> of this myſtery, as the ſhield that muſt <hi>defend us againſt all adverſity</hi> whatſoever, by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching us to bear off all the blowes of Infidelity, after we ſee Faith to be an elevated reaſon which ſecures us: Points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are not therefore againſt reaſon, becauſe they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times above it. O what a ſeeing blindneſſe is this, when we believe of God what we do not know! I can liken it to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then to the means wherewith our Saviour cured the blind mans ſight, by putting dirt into his eyes: juſt ſuch is the darkneſſe of knowledge in this myſtery to the light of Faith it brings into our ſouls. To conclude, ſince the report between the prayer and other parts of this dayes ſervice is even literal, we need no labour to make it appear ſuiting with our main deſign of this book, ſhewing a harmony between them all.</p>

                           <p n="33">33. HEere we are firſt to note, that height and <hi>depth</hi> how ever ſeeming to differ even in their natures, as well as in their names, are oftentimes taken both for one and the ſame notion; as for example, that which we in our climate call <hi>depth</hi> or profundity, (as relating to things below us) to the Antipodes that ſame thing is height or altitude above them, namely the Hemiſphere or arch of the heavens under the earth to us, which is over the earth to them; and the arch of the heavens over our heads is, as it were, under the earth to them: again, if any of the Antipodes ſhould from the footing he hath upon the earth fall with his head from us downward, he would ſeem indeed to fall, and yet that fall would be his riſing up towards heaven; and the like fall to them, would our riſing ſeem to be, if from our footing we departed hence up towards heaven: in like manner we call a deep Well high, and a high Well deep. So by <hi>depth of the riches of God</hi> is here underſtood the height thereof; though for him that is all in all there is neither <hi>depth</hi> nor height, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for want of better expreſſion we uſe ſuch terms; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle here under one terme expreſſeth both <hi>depth</hi> and height of <hi>Gods riches;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, <hi>O deep height, O high depth of the riches</hi> of Almighty God! And though St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſo point this verſe, as they joyn the <hi>depth</hi> both to the <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> and in them make up the <hi>depth of his riches;</hi> yet St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, Origen,</hi> and others (following the Greek and Syriack pointings of this ſentence) ſeem to attinge the ſenſe of this place more home, diſtinguiſhing the ſenſe, and meaning it to be tripartite, not ſingle, that is to ſay, attributing the <hi>depth</hi> equally to the <hi>riches,</hi> the <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> as it were three things equally <hi>high,</hi> and equally <hi>deep</hi> beyond humane or Angelical underſtandings: for firſt, the <hi>riches</hi> here mentioned report to the infinite mercies of God inſiſted on by the Apoſtle, ſaying in the two and twentieth verſe, <hi>God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:204830:325"/> hath concluded all in incredulity, that thence he might ſhew his mercy unto all;</hi> by making the incredulity of the Jewes the cauſe of his mercy turning to the Gentiles, and ſo converting them to the <hi>right</hi> Faith; as alſo ſome Jews ſhall be converted by the exemplarity of the Gentiles becoming good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Secondly, the three after queſtions in this Epiſtle ſhew theſe three are to be read diſtinct, and ſo underſtood; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>who knew the mind of God? who was of his Counſel? who firſt gave to him, and it ſhall be reſtored?</hi> And we are to note by <hi>riches</hi> the Apoſtle underſtands the mercies of God, whereby he makes us <hi>rich,</hi> in all gifts of grace and glory, as appears <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7. where the Apoſtle ſayes we receive mercy <hi>according to the riches of his grace.</hi> The true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine meaning therefore of this place is, O profound <hi>depth of the mercies, wiſdome, and knowledge of God!</hi> of his <hi>mercy,</hi> extended to all Nations; of his <hi>wiſdome,</hi> making even the incredulity of the Infidels to be the motive to convert Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; of his <hi>knowledge,</hi> penetrating all future, preſent, paſt and contingent things at once. And indeed theſe three points are the ſcope of all the Apoſtle aymes at from the ninth to this eleventh Chapter to the Romans; for it was a ſpecial deſign of God to ſend his Sacred Son poor and abject amongſt the Jews, who had he come in a ſplendid way, would have been undoubtedly received by them: but if we ask the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why God would do this, there is no better can be given, then in brief, <hi>O the depth of Gods riches and mercies, of his wiſdome, and of his knowledge!</hi> This is <hi>the Abyſſe that calls upon the Abyſſe;</hi> in fine this is a reaſon above all reaſon, but that, which being increate it ſelf, creates the reaſons of men and Angels as ſhort of it ſelf, as finite things are ſhort of infinite, as creatures are ſhort of their Creatour. The Apoſtle ends this verſe with an extatical admiration of Gods <hi>incomprehenſible Judgments,</hi> and <hi>inveſtigable wayes;</hi> that is to ſay, the counſels, means, works, and reaſons of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who alone can cull Good out of evil; as he doth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing all Nations of incredulity, that thence he may make one the motive for his <hi>mercy</hi> towards the other, as was ſaid above.</p>
                           <p n="34">
                              <pb n="32" facs="tcp:204830:326"/>34. How are we loſt in our judgments, when we ſee the wicked proſper, and the juſt afflicted? when we value hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane abilities, which in ſight of God are follies? becauſe we do not <hi>know</hi> the ſenſe, <hi>the mind of God</hi> in theſe his permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor how contemptible a thing the wiſeſt man under the cope of heaven is in the ſight of God; of whom Zeno ſaid well, "that the paſtime or ſport of God was man: as if God made but a Tennis ball of man, or of the wiſdome of men, toſſing him up and down at pleaſure to the wonderment of us poor mortalls; Whence the <hi>Abyſſe</hi> of humane miſery calls upon the <hi>Abyſſe</hi> of Divine <hi>mercy,</hi> and, as S. Auguſtine ſaith, <q>the <hi>Abyſs</hi> of humane ignorance calls upon the <hi>Abyſs</hi> of the Divine <hi>knowledge</hi> or ſcience.</q> How well then doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>who knowes the mind of God? or who was ever of his Counſel?</hi> that is, as Iſaias ſaid Chap. 40. v. 13. who ever gave him counſel, or who did he ever make acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch counſel as he gave himſelf, in all internall and external operations? whence no man muſt dare to ask, why leaving the Jewes, he turned to the Gentiles, or the like.</p>
                           <p n="35">35. This place is remarkable; for it is not asked who ever gave God any thing? but, <hi>who hath firſt given him any thing,</hi> which before he had not received from him? that ſo he might be able to make God his debtour? truly no man; and for this reaſon S. Paul ſayes well, <hi>what have you, that you have not received? and if you have received it, why do you glory, as if it had not been received by you,</hi> but were your own? Yet ſuch is God Almighty his <hi>mercy</hi> to mankind, that even this impoſſibility in man to make God his debtour, by <hi>giving him any thing</hi> (that was not his own before,) doth not hinder man of the honour to have God a debtour to him: But then we muſt underſtand this ſaying ſafely, and take heed we make not God our debtour for any gift or loan of ours to him, but meerly for his own promiſes to us; and thoſe his promiſes, though he were graciouſly pleaſed to make them voluntarily unto us, yet he binds himſelf by vertue of his own promiſe to be our debtour, for the performance of his words unto us:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:204830:326"/> to which purpoſe St. Auguſtine ſpake home in theſe words, upon this place of the Apoſtle Serm. 16. <q>Pay unto us, what thou doeſt owe us, becauſe we have done what thou haſt bid us to do; though even what we have done were thy deed too, becauſe thou didſt help us to do it.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p n="36">36. And for further proof of this doctrine the Apoſtle proceeds, ſaying, <hi>of him, by him, in him are all things;</hi> that is to ſay, not onely the eſſence or beeing of every thing, but alſo the operations thereof, ſince the operations of creatures are likewiſe creatures too, as well as the things themſelves that do operate, and ſo both have equal dependance on Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: ſo that <hi>all things</hi> are <hi>of him,</hi> as of their firſt maker; <hi>by him,</hi> as by their directour, diſpoſer, and perfectour; <hi>in him,</hi> as in vertue of his aſſiſtance they are made, do ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and are conſerved. But St. Auguſtine, and with him the torrent of Fathers obſerve, that what is ſaid to be <hi>of God</hi> is appropriated to the <hi>Father,</hi> what <hi>by God</hi> is attributed to the <hi>Son,</hi> and what <hi>in God</hi> is reporting to the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> that ſo to the whole ſacred and undivided Trinity we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the honour and glory of all beeing and operation of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: inſomuch that even from the Apoſtles time, the cloſe of prayer was made in this ſort, <hi>Glory be to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;</hi> and by the Councill of Nice was added thereunto, <hi>as it was in the beginning, and now, and ever world without end,</hi> Amen. For though here be ground of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Perſons, yet there is none of dividing eſſences or natures; and therefore the Apoſtle telling us here of our obligation to the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> concludes ſaying, not to them but <hi>to him be glory for ever;</hi> that is, to the one only undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided <hi>God,</hi> who is nevertheleſſe diſtinguiſhed into three ſeveral Perſons, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> A very apt cloſe for the Epiſtle on Trinity Sunday.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. WE have hinted in the Illuſtration above at the deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of holy Church in cloſing up the grand work of humane Redemption, (and the Octave of the holy Ghoſt) with a Feaſt made ſacred to the B. Trinity; wherein our <hi>Faith</hi> ſeems to be chiefly and wholly exerciſed, becauſe there is nothing ſo hard in Chriſtian doctrine as to <hi>believe the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the ſacred Triunity:</hi> Now we may preſume to affirm further, that albeit from Pentecoſt to Advent, the main aym of Chriſtian duty be the exerciſe of charity, in producing frequent acts thereof; nevertheleſſe it was fitting to begin the practice of <hi>charity</hi> with an <hi>act of Faith,</hi> to ſhew the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between our <hi>love</hi> of God on Earth, and our <hi>love</hi> of him in Heaven: for there, <hi>Faith</hi> ſhall ceaſe, that <hi>Love</hi> may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and be alone the Totall duty of the Bleſſed; but here, <hi>Faith</hi> muſt increaſe, leaſt <hi>Love</hi> decreaſe in us: Hence it was not onely fit that this our firſt <hi>act of charity</hi> to day ſhould be to God, but that it ſhould be alſo accompanied with the ſtrongeſt <hi>act of Faith</hi> imaginable, which is this we now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in making profeſſion <hi>we believe God to be Trine and One.</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. Now not to break the order of the ſervice, that I mean of charity, (the main imploy of every Chriſtian between this and the holy time of Advent) ſee how (by way of comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration at leaſt, of the firſt Sunday after Pentecoſt,) we have regard to ſuch another Prayer, and ſuch another Goſpel (whereunto I have added here the Epiſtle alſo, though not read in open ſervice) as do mainly point <hi>at charity;</hi> ſo ſhall we ſee in their peruſal anon, when theſe (proper to the day) are done.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:204830:327"/> ſo ſtrong a <hi>Hope</hi> in her <hi>believing,</hi> and in her <hi>loving</hi> God, that ſhe puts it as a hopeful ſhield before her againſt <hi>all Adverſity</hi> whatſoever, to <hi>be firm</hi> in her <hi>belief of the most Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and undivided Trinity.</hi>

                           <p n="18">18. THe Evangeliſt in this Chapter recounts the appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus in Galilee to a great number of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and friends, as well as unto the Apoſtles amongſt them, who were now ſo far fled from Jeruſalem, where formerly they had ſeen him, after he aroſe from his grave: and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them in the truth of this myſtery, that though in the precedent verſe St. Matthew ſayes, <hi>ſome of them doubted</hi> of this truth, that Chriſt was riſen, yet the meaning is not, that any of the Apoſtles doubted thereof, but <hi>ſome</hi> others, to whom Chriſt had never appeared before, as now he did, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:204830:328"/> confirm the truth of his <hi>reſurrection. And Jeſus coming neer,</hi> not to thoſe doubting perſons, but to his Apoſtles; <hi>ſaying,</hi> as this dayes Goſpel begins, <hi>All power,</hi> &amp;c. But we are to obſerve, though S. Matthew ſeems in this chapter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the power of Miſſion given by Chriſt to his Apoſtles unto this ſtory of his Apparition to them and above three thouſand more in Galilee, ſince he reſolved to end his Goſpel in this eight and twentieth chapter and write no more; yet the very truth is, thoſe words were not ſpoken by Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to this apparition, but afterwards upon the Mount Olivet, when at his Aſcenſion he gave the Apoſtles Miſſion over all the world for his valediction or laſt farewell unto them: and in teſtimony that this was an Act of high Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, he tells them at the ſame time, <hi>All power is given unto him both in heaven and earth;</hi> ſo they need not doubt, but he that gave them this <hi>Miſſion</hi> to all Nations, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to preach unto them, and to Baptize them, had am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple authority for his ſo doing, and would by his grace from heaven ſecond their labours over all the earth, and make them fruitful to the final ſalvation of all Nations, which was a convincing teſtimony of his being <hi>plenipotentiary</hi> between God and man, or having plenitude of <hi>power both in heaven and earth.</hi> But we are further here to note, that this pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>power</hi> was not now ſo given to Chriſt, as if he had not had it before; for the <hi>Word</hi> was no ſooner Incarnate, then this <hi>power</hi> was begun in him, though he was not pleaſed to mention the accompliſhment or perfection thereof, untill by his death and paſſion he had merited the ſame, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuiting to him, not onely as he was God, but as he was man, the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or Saviour of the world, and to him alone; for to no man elſe was the amplitude of this <hi>power</hi> competent; nay the very participation thereof is above all merit of any pure humane creature: however to Chriſt <hi>the fulneſſe</hi> of it was but due, by reaſon of his being one perſon with God, who as Creatour of heaven and earth had conſequently full <hi>power</hi> over them both; ſo as he could by the Miniſtery of his Apoſtles preaching, ſubject unto himſelf all the Nations of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:204830:328"/> the earth, as ſtooping to the <hi>power</hi> of his Faith and Doctrine; and afterwards in heaven reward this their <hi>Faith,</hi> this their ſubjection to Chriſtian diſcipline with crowns of eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to ſhew he was chief commandant in heaven alſo, having purchaſed the ſame by his bitter death and paſſion, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to make eternally happy in this his glorious Kingdom whoſoever he pleaſed.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. We are here to obſerve, when Chriſt bids <hi>go,</hi> it is not (nay it cannot be) in the power of any mortal man to forbid the Miniſters of Chriſt from <hi>going</hi> to convert <hi>nations:</hi> So this Miſſion is <hi>Divine,</hi> not humane, and gives <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to execute Gods Lawes, maugre all mens prohibitions. <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith he, to ſhew us, labour, pains, travel, diligence are the marks of thoſe who preach the word of God: nor is this labour limited to any one time or place, but extends it ſelf to all times, <hi>to all nations. Go,</hi> ſayes our Saviour, <hi>teach all nations,</hi> nay he adds, <hi>therefore go,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Go,</hi> becauſe I ſend you, that have <hi>all power both</hi> in heaven and earth, <hi>go, teach ye all nations,</hi> as I have taught you: Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, the command of learning was impoſed upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, while the precept of teaching was laid upon the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours; for in theſe latter it is indeed that Chriſt after ſaid, <hi>he would be with them unto the end of the world;</hi> that is, in aſſiſting their <hi>Succeſſours</hi> he would be with them. And very great reaſon it is that an obligation of hearing ſhould fall upon the people, when a command of preaching was impoſed on the Prieſt: for a Schollar is acorrelative to a Maſter, as a Son is to a Father; ſince no man can be an actual maſter unleſs he have an actual Schollar, nor can any man be a father, that hath not a child. And that it was a command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with an obligation to be put in preſent execution, ſee how Chriſt tyes himſelf to an actual aſſiſtance thereof <hi>even to the worlds end.</hi> And as he bids them <hi>go and teach all nations</hi> the principles of Chriſtian doctrine, namely thoſe of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; ſo he bids them <hi>Baptize</hi> all thoſe whom they inſtruct and teach, <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</hi> to ſhew them the true mark of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:204830:329"/> is his belief in <hi>the Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> which is one onely God, and three Divine Perſons diſtinct each from other, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> Nor can there be indeed a more ſuccinct method of this deep myſtery, then is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, when the command of Baptizing in the <hi>name,</hi> and not in the <hi>names</hi> ſhewes the unity of God, and denyes the plurality of Divine nature or eſſence; and yet the ſpecifying of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhewes the Bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is in that ſacred unity: Whence we ſee the word Trinity doth import a <hi>Triunity,</hi> or an Unity of nature in a Trinity of perſons; whence our Saviour ſaying by the mouth of his Apoſtle, 1 Epiſt. Joh. c. 5. <hi>There are three that bear teſtimony in heaven, the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> adds immediately, <hi>and theſe Three are all one;</hi> that is to ſay, theſe diſtinct perſons are one indiſtinct and undivided nature, eſſence, deity; ſo as, though there be three divine perſons, yet is there but one onely God. And no marvel if upon Trinity Sunday both the Epiſtle and Goſpel report unto this ſacred myſtery; for it is indeed the higheſt article of our <hi>Faith,</hi> the firſt and main principle of Chriſtian Religion. But to conclude this doctrine</p>
                           <p n="20">20. See how the beginning of this verſe tells (beſides this myſtery) what the Apoſtles were commanded to <hi>teach</hi> the world, namely <hi>to do all whatſoever Chriſt commanded</hi> them to deliver, as the Will of God; that is to ſay, as well to do good works, as to believe aright, and to profeſſe that Faith which was preached unto them: and how ever Luther and Calvin pretend, the Church of Chriſt and the right admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments thereof, and of the divine Services had failed for many hundred of years together, before they arrogated to themſelves a kind of new Apoſtolate forſooth; yet it is from hence confidently aſſerted by the unanimous conſent of all Catholick Doctours and Divines, that there neither hath been hitherto, nor ever ſhall be hereafter, till the day of doom, which is <hi>the conſummation or end of the world,</hi> any failure in the Church of Chriſt, nor in Chriſt his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual aſſiſtance and preſence with his ever viſible Church: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:204830:329"/> that he is ever viſibly preſent in his perpetual viſible rulers of the Church, and inviſibly in his continual-aſſiſting grace; and hence it is evidently proved, that albeit no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of the Apoſtles had thoſe ample prerogatives which they enjoyed, yet their Miniſtery is ſo the ſame that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was, as Chriſt is ſaid even to perpetuate the Apoſtles in their ſucceſſours, and his preſence with them in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with their followers; and in his aſſiſting them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly as he did aſſiſt their predeceſſours, though perhaps not as amply, nor as efficaciouſly at all times: For how elſe can it be true, that Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles, he would ſend them another Comforter, that ſhould aſſiſt them eternally, not in their perſons, but in their ſucceſſours <hi>to the worlds end?</hi> For the ſame are the gifts of Chriſt and of the Holy Ghoſt, as far forth, as they are both one and the ſame God. Nay more, Chriſt is even viſibly remaining with the Miniſters of his Church in the holy Euchariſt or B. Sacrament of the Altar, his bleſſed body and bloud being expoſed perpetually to the receiving and adoration of the people: more, he is viſibly with us in his Prieſts, who are his viſible inſtruments to adminiſter the Sacraments, and offer ſacrifice unto the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Deity; for though the Prieſt be the inſtrumental, yet Chriſt is the chief and principal Prieſt himſelf; it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him to be both Sacrifice and Sacrificant: ſo as in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the accidents of bodies, we are ſaid conſequently to ſee the things whoſe accidents we ſee; in like manner by ſeeing the <hi>Sacramental ſpecies,</hi> we may be ſaid to ſee the Sacrament, the body and bloud of Chriſt, whoſe accidents they are after conſecration, though the <hi>ſame species</hi> before were the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of bread and wine. To conclude, we may as truly ſay, Chriſt is viſibly with his Church <hi>to the worlds end;</hi> as we may ſay a mans ſoul is viſibly in his body, that is to ſay, perceptibly, ſo long as a man lives and hath motion: for look what the ſoul is to the body, the ſame Chriſt is to his Church; ſo that as the ſoul is the bodies natural life, Chriſt is the ſupernatural life of the ſoul believing in him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her ſelf (by that belief) a member of his Church: for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:204830:330"/> as the ſoul makes the body move, ſo Chriſt makes his Church to do, according to that of S. Paul, <hi>Philipp.</hi> 2. <hi>he worketh all in all according to the purpoſe of his own holy will;</hi> and again, he it is that gives a will to do good, and a power to put that will in execution, and to perfect by him, what was undertaken for him, as being to his honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

                           <p>ALbeit this Sunday is never ſerved, but with a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made thereof upon Trinity Sunday, (which it alwayes falls upon, and whereunto with great reaſon it gives place in the publick Solemnity of holy Churches ſervice;) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe we are not forbidden in our private devotions to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:204830:331"/> make uſe of the comfort, which this prayer (adjuſted to the Epiſtle and Goſpel proper thereunto) will afford us; ſince the Goſpel and the Prayer are both read to day by way of Commemoration of this firſt Sunday, as above; and ſince the whole Maſſe of this Sunday is ſaid at the pleaſure of the Prieſt, (no double feaſts occurring) between this and Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day next, which is the Feaſt of <hi>Corpus Chriſti:</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there is a world of ſweet devotion in the expoſition both of this Epiſtle and Goſpel, I hope it will encourage all good Chriſtians to read, both what is written upon the Bleſſed Trinity, and this Sunday too, before next Sunday come: ſince it is but this week of all the year, that they will have ſo much to read, and which (if I miſtake not,) will ſeem but little neither, 'tis all ſo ſweet. But becauſe the task of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be double, I ſhall abridge the gloſſe of the Prayer, and ſuffice my ſelf to ſhew the conſtant connexion between this and the other parts of holy Churches Service to day, by ſumming up the Epiſtle and Goſpel, as both teaching <hi>perfect charity,</hi> while they extend it to <hi>the love of our enemies;</hi> and as being both abſtracted in this prayer, which after an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgment of our own <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> confeſſing all our <hi>ſtrength</hi> is from Almighty God, without whom our <hi>mortall infirmity is of no ability,</hi> petitions the <hi>aſſiſtance of his grace,</hi> that in <hi>doing his commands, we may pleaſe him hoth in will and work.</hi> And truly all his commands are included in theſe two precepts of charity, ſo much inſiſted on both in the Epiſtle and Goſpel; namely that <hi>of loving God above all things, and our neighbours as our ſelves;</hi> which then we ſhall do perfectly, when we love our enemies; becauſe this love will make us indeed have no enemies at all, and ſo be as little troubled at what injury other men can do us, as we ſhould be at our ſelves, if by chance we were cauſes of our own miſchiefs; for though we might be diſturbed a little thereat, yet never ſo much, as to looſe our charity, or to hate our ſelves; nor conſequently can we hate our enemies, if we once arrive at the perfection of that commandment, which bids us love our neighbours as our ſelves. Which that we may
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:204830:332"/> do, this is very aptly made the Churches Prayer to day, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Gods aſſiſting grace, that</hi> in <hi>doing his commands, we may pleaſe him both in work and will:</hi> in <hi>work,</hi> by executing his commands compleatly and perfectly; in <hi>will,</hi> by doing them readily and cheerfully. And it is worthy our remark, that on the ſame Trinity Sunday, where we have the deepeſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Faith</hi> recommended by holy Church, we ſhould have alſo the higheſt act <hi>of Charity</hi> inculcated unto us, that ſo we might ſee <hi>the firmneſſe of our Faith</hi> to day petitioned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted <hi>in the operation of our Love according to the ſame Faith;</hi> and that Chriſtian perfection is never attained, till we arrive unto perfect <hi>Charity,</hi> which is the nerve that links together the members of the Churches myſtical body, and unites them all unto their head Chriſt Jeſus, as the ſinewes of natural bodies knit together the members thereof.

St. John in this Epiſtle ver. 7. had ſaid, <hi>every one that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth is born of God,</hi> and <hi>knoweth God;</hi> now he gives the reaſon thereof in this eighth verſe, proving the ſame <hi>à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trario</hi> as School-men ſay, by an argument from the contrary aſſertion: <hi>he that loveth not, knoweth not God, becauſe God is charity</hi> or love: not but that we may ſpeculatively <hi>know God</hi> without <hi>loving him,</hi> but practically or experimentally we cannot <hi>know him,</hi> unleſſe we actually love him: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, all men know ſpeculatively that honey is ſweet, but they know it practically only when they taſte it: And though the ſame argument holds in all Gods attributes, as in his power, in his wiſdome, &amp;c. (ſince he is omnipotency and omniſcience) yet St. John argues thus onely upon <hi>his charity,</hi> becauſe the ſubject he now undertakes is the commends of <hi>Charity.</hi> Again between lovers, <hi>love</hi> is the main thing they delight in; and much more is it ſo betwixt God and us, for he doth not onely love us, (and ſo is our lover) but is himſelf <hi>love,</hi> nay if we ſay, he is the <hi>love,</hi> by which we love him too, perhaps we ſhall not ſay amiſſe; and S. John being wholly inamoured with the <hi>love of God,</hi> breaks into the recommends of charity, as the vertue himſelf was moſt excellent in, and wherein he would have us moſt to excell. So for the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of what this Epiſtle is to dilate upon, we ſee it begins thus, <hi>God is charity,</hi> both Eſſential and Notional: Eſſential, as it is the nature of the Deity; Notional, as it is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſons, and ſo ſignifies perſonally the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> who by <hi>love</hi> proceeding from the Father and the Son, is called <hi>the love of them both,</hi> uniting them and him all in one indiſtinct eſſence, diſtinguiſhed into three diſtinct perſons: now the true reaſon why God is called <hi>charity</hi> is, becauſe he is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelf, which is <hi>charity</hi> communicative and diffuſive of it ſelf.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. But this next ſhews clearly why St. John calls God <hi>Charity;</hi> becauſe he appeared ſo to be, by ſending his onely
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:204830:333"/> begotten Son into the world, <hi>that we may live by him,</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to the like in his Goſpel, chap. 3. v. 19.) who by Adam were all dead. And this <hi>love</hi> he ſhewed us, as an example for us to give our ſelves to him by again.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. For <hi>in this,</hi> that is to ſay, in our re-dilection or reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of <hi>love</hi> for <hi>love,</hi> conſiſteth <hi>charity,</hi> which can never be in us to God but reciprocal between God and us, though in us to others it may be not mutual, and <hi>de facto,</hi> in very deed, in God to us it was ſo, when <hi>he loved us</hi> before we <hi>loved</hi> him; for it was impoſſible we ſhould have loved him before <hi>he loved</hi> us; and therefore we are inabled to re-love him, becauſe his previous love to us inkindled our ſubſequent <hi>love</hi> to him. Whence the Apoſtle ſayes, our <hi>charity</hi> doth not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in that we love God; as in that God loves us, and makes us thereby able to re-love him, becauſe <hi>he ſent his Son a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our ſins.</hi> St. Auguſtine ſayes briefly (and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well) upon this place, tract. 9. <q>God loved the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to make them pious, the unjuſt to make them juſt, the ſick to make them whole; and why may not we adde he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them that hated him, to make them love him, for ſending his Son a Sacrifice for his utter enemies?</q> O how contrary is this to the courſe of the world, which is to revenge our ſelves on thoſe that love us not! O how truly is it ſaid of God, Eſay 55.8, 9. <hi>My wayes are not like your wayes, but exalted from them, as high as heaven from earth!</hi> yet S. Paul ſhews us, we may follow God marching above us, as high as heaven is from earth, when Rom. 9. v. 2 he deſired to be <hi>Anathema, accurſed</hi> to ſave the Jewes his perſecutours, and conſequently his utter enemies.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. <hi>If</hi> is here a cauſal, not a doubting or conditional par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle; as who ſhould ſay, becauſe <hi>God hath</hi> thus <hi>loved us, we muſt</hi> therefore <hi>love one another.</hi> In like manner <hi>And</hi> was taken cauſally, when Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples, as in his Goſpel, Joh. 13. v. 14. <hi>I have waſhed your feet, being your Lord and Maſter; And you muſt waſh one anothers feet;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>becauſe you muſt,</hi> &amp;c. Hence learn to humble your ſelves to your fellow ſervants, ſince I your Lord your God
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204830:334"/> have humbled my ſelf to you. And we may note the deep art of this phraſe in St. John, who rather ſayes admiring, <hi>If God</hi> hath thus loved us, then, <hi>becauſe God hath thus loved us,</hi> &amp;c. to ſhew it doth not follow, we can render equally to God, we can love him, as well as he can love us; So it is not ſaid <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> love him again; but rather <hi>if</hi> God hath loved us, <hi>and we muſt love one another;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, ſince we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate love for love to God, let us at leaſt <hi>love one another,</hi> let us for his ſake, love our neighbours as our ſelves, ſince he dyed equally for them as for us: for as S. Matthew tells us Chap. 25. v. 40. <hi>what you did to the leaſt of my brethren, you did to me.</hi> And indeed ſince God cannot perſonally want any thing, that we are able to give him, he hath afforded us this means to relieve him (as wanting), when we relieve the neceſſities of our neighbours. So the ſenſe of this verſe is ſtrong, and even inforcing us to <hi>love one another:</hi> Since God ſo unlike to us, ſo much above us in perfection hath ſtooped ſo low as to love us; how much more ought we, that are all one like another, to love each other; ſince like naturally runs to like, and naturally loves what is like unto it?</p>
                           <p n="12">12. This verſe corroborates the explications of the former, as ſaying, though God be in himſelf Inviſible, yet if <hi>we love our neighbour,</hi> God is by his Divine and indiviſible vertue of charity united to us, and made, as it were, one in, and with us; whereby <hi>our charity is rendered perfect:</hi> nay even the Inviſible God becomes as it were viſible, both in us, by the viſible charity we ſhew to others, and in our neighbour whom we love, as the viſible image of the inviſible Deity. But we ſhall do well to ſee upon this occaſion, how theſe words are ſafely expounded, <hi>God no man ever ſaw:</hi> For which purpoſe turn to the expoſition upon 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. on <hi>Septuageſima</hi> Sunday, declaring what S. Paul ſaw in his rapture: but for preſent let us take it with the common ſenſe of Expoſitours; that no pure man ever in this world or in heaven can with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral eyes ſee God his eſſence or divine nature; though Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius à Lapide preſumes to ſay, Chriſt being both God and Man did ſee his own divinity: whence neither Moyſes nor
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:204830:334"/> St. Paul did thus ſee him; and that ſight the Bleſſed have of him in heaven is more by way of grace, then of nature, and this indeed more with the ſoules underſtanding, then with the bodies eyes. To conclude this verſe, a thing is then <hi>perfect,</hi> when it conſiſts intirely of all its parts; and <hi>charity</hi> we know to be tripartite, conſiſting of our love to God, which alone is not perfect, unleſſe we love our neighbour alſo as we do our ſelves; for theſe are both integral, and eſſential parts of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect charity:</hi> And while we have charity thus <hi>perfected,</hi> then though we ſee not God, yet he both regards, and <hi>abides in us,</hi> by reaſon of this divine vertue of charity, uniting God to all, and all to God again. Beſides we <hi>perfect</hi> even the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> we love God with all, when we extend it to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour too; ſince we cannot love one another for Gods ſake, but we muſt love God more then we did before. Laſtly, when the text ſayes <hi>his charity,</hi> we may underſtand it, as if truly <hi>the charity of God</hi> to us were <hi>perfected</hi> by our loving each other; ſince while we do ſo, <hi>God abideth in us,</hi> and <hi>his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is</hi> thereby <hi>perfected;</hi> not ſo, as to make it more in it ſelf, but to make it more in us, and to appear alſo more to others, which is a kind of <hi>perfection</hi> too: and in particular <hi>charity is perfected</hi> by loving our enemies, which being a love none but God hath taught us, God in this hath appeared more <hi>perfect</hi> to us, then in any thing elſe he ever did; becauſe he became a <hi>propitiation</hi> even for us that were all his enemies, before his <hi>charity (perfected in us)</hi> made us his friends, and him our Saviour, and ſo finally gave him an opportunity, who was in himſelf all <hi>perfection,</hi> to receive (in our eſteems at leaſt) an addition to his innate <hi>perfection,</hi> if not a new <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> by our imperfection; which is another way of verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what St. Paul ſaith 2 Cor. 12.9. of <hi>vertue being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in infirmity,</hi> then was ſhewed when that text was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded 1 Cor. 12.9. upon <hi>Sexageſima</hi> Sunday. St. Auſtin upon this text, <hi>tract.</hi> 7. ſhewes a fine progreſſe of Charity in perfection: <q>The fire of our charity firſt ſeizeth upon our neighbour, and afterward extends it ſelf more abroad: it firſt helps our Brother, or our kindred, or friends, next
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:204830:335"/> ſome ſtranger, but at laſt our enemy. And <hi>tract.</hi> 8. Love him, who is now come to dwell within you, that by his more perfect poſſeſſing you, he may render you alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p n="13">13. And this next verſe ſhewes us a ſign, how to know when <hi>he is within us;</hi> namely, when <hi>he gives us of his Spirit</hi> of loving one another, even our enemies; for by this it is evident <hi>he is in us,</hi> who only taught us that which onely him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could do: and it followes evidently, that whenſoever <hi>God is in us, we are in him,</hi> becauſe whereſoever God is, he unites the place ſo to himſelf by his immenſity, as the place or ſubject he is in, rather is ſaid to be in him, then he in it. And conſequently if we feel <hi>his Spirit in us,</hi> that is, if we love each other, eſpecially our enemies, we may boldly conclude that not onely <hi>God is in us,</hi> but that we alſo are, and remain in him, ſo long as by ſuch dilection his Divine Spirit <hi>aboades in us.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>he that adheres to God is one Spirit with him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="14">14. 15. Which doctrine the Evangeliſt finds both ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and ſo ſweet, that in theſe two verſes he proves it to be as really intended by him, as it is pretended, taught, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Catholick Church: for, ſaith he, <hi>we that have ſeen</hi> can, and <hi>do teſtifie</hi> that <hi>God ſent his Son to ſave the world;</hi> and by confeſſing <hi>Jeſus to be his Son,</hi> we remain in God, and he in us; we in him by Faith; and he in us by the gift of that Divine vertue, which can ſlow from no other ſource, but his infinite goodneſſe and bounty; as St. Paul ſayes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Chriſt by Faith dwelleth in our hearts.</hi> This S. John incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with ſpecial regard to Ebion, Cerinthus, and others, who at that time denyed the Divinity of Chriſt: ſo for proof hereof he expoſeth himſelf, and all the Colledge of Chriſt his Apoſtles and diſciples, who as ear and eye-witneſſes were ready to <hi>teſtifie</hi> the ſame to all the world, as they all did by their glorious Martyrdomes.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. In this verſe the Evangeliſt gives the ſame <hi>teſtimony</hi> for the <hi>charity</hi> of God being in us, as he did in the fourteenth verſe for <hi>Chriſt the Son of God being in the world;</hi> that ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:204830:335"/> we may be fully poſſeſſed of that Truth, and inamoured on that vertue which he himſelf is even tranſported with, and cannot ſpeak but in commendations of, being, as it were, all on fire therewith. For if we mark him, his words fall from him all circular, like balls of fire: From <hi>God</hi> he comes to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>charity,</hi> from <hi>charity</hi> to <hi>love</hi> of our <hi>neighbours,</hi> thence back to <hi>Chriſt</hi> again, now to his <hi>charity;</hi> and all to ſhew he moves onely in the circle or orbe of <hi>Love,</hi> and cannot wheel himſelf out of it, but windes all his ſpeech into pleaſing Meanders of that ſubject, wherein to be loſt is to be ſound, becauſe who is not found in the labyrinth of charity is a loſt ſoul: and therefore St. John having gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Maze by the clew that leads through all the Meanders of it, <hi>God himſelf,</hi> (as this Epiſtle began, <hi>God is charity</hi>) muſt needs come out with the ſame clew again, which is <hi>charity both to God and man;</hi> wherewith he cloſeth this Epiſtle, to ſhew us, he hath been through all the turnings and windings of <hi>love,</hi> or elſe he could never have come out the ſame way he went into this re-ſelfing circle of <hi>charity,</hi> which this verſe delightfully winds us into, and brings us out again: for if <hi>God be charity,</hi> who <hi>remains in it remains in God,</hi> and <hi>God in him,</hi> as a circle remains in a ring, and a ring in a circle; but with this difference, <hi>we in him,</hi> as in our increated, <hi>he in us</hi> as in his created Temple, where he moſt delights to be; we rings in him, as in the circle of his Immenſity, he circled in us, as his Immenſity is capable of being in a ring of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. The amorous Evangeliſt having told us much before, how even the increated charity is <hi>perfected</hi> (in our eſteems) by juxtapoſition to our imperfections; now he tells us, how our created charity is perfected in us, by our truſt, and <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God,</hi> even when creatures may pretend moſt to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in him, <hi>at the day of Judgement;</hi> and he gives a ſtrange reaſon for this <hi>confidence,</hi> becauſe as <hi>he is</hi> (meaning as God and Chriſt is) <hi>we alſo are in the world:</hi> So here <hi>In this,</hi> &amp;c. imports either that to this end charity was given us, not to fear him our Judge, who had given us the grace to love him;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:204830:336"/> or that really <hi>this is</hi> the perfection of charity in us, that as he loved us, without fear to take upon him our infirmities or imperfections, and gave himſelf wholly into our hands to be even <hi>his Judges;</hi> ſo we muſt <hi>love</hi> him, by aſſuming as many of his perfections as we can, and by freely making him our <hi>Judge,</hi> without fear of receiving any hard meaſure at his hands, if we can truly ſay, we <hi>love him</hi> with all our hearts, as he loved us when he was adjudged to death by us: Or as St. Auguſtine ſayes, <hi>In this</hi> ſignifies, it is a true ſigne that our charity is perfect, if as the Juſt and Saints in heaven co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet the day of Judgment, ſo we alſo do, that God may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be glorified before all the world, what ere become of us, becauſe <hi>we</hi> in that caſe <hi>are in the world,</hi> as God, as <hi>Chriſt was in it,</hi> perfectly loving, and ſo not fearing us, though he ſee cauſe enough of fear amongſt ſo many Traytours, if he had been capable of harm; ſo if we can arrive <hi>to love God</hi> thus <hi>perfectly,</hi> we may truly ſay <hi>we are as he was in the world, without fear,</hi> even of <hi>Judgment,</hi> becauſe we have no cauſe to fear corruption in him, as he mought have had in us; and therefore may come with more confidence to his tribunal, then he did to ours, that is, <hi>may be in this world as he was, without fear,</hi> becauſe we are in <hi>love:</hi> for the Evangeliſt here proves two effects of perfect love, the firſt is <hi>confidence</hi> in God, both living and dying; the ſecond is <hi>caſting away all fear.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="18">18. As in termes this verſe avoucheth the ſecond, having declared the firſt immediately before; ſo that as <hi>charity</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth <hi>confidence</hi> in us, this <hi>confidence expelleth fear out of us,</hi> and thus becomes, as Ariſtotle ſayes, cauſe of the effect, in being cauſe of the cauſe thereof. But we ſhall do well to examine what <hi>fear</hi> it is, that charity expells, leaſt by <hi>not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgment,</hi> we fall into the errour of hereti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ks, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they are certain of their ſalvation. By <hi>fear</hi> therefore is here meant deſpair, ſuch as dejected conſciences uſe to have, whereas none ſuch enters into thoſe that have perfect charity: Secondly, he alludes to that <hi>fear</hi> which in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5 <hi>v.</hi> 5. we read of, even <hi>for remitted ſins be not without fear,</hi> which yet a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:204830:336"/> perfect lover needs not <hi>fear,</hi> but this is ſaid to imperfect <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of God: Thirdly, he means <hi>ſervile fear,</hi> ſuch as makes us ſerve God meerly for <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>hell;</hi> not <hi>filial fear,</hi> for that is compatible with (nay eſſential unto) perfect love, as we read <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.28. <hi>who is without fear</hi> (namely filial) <hi>cannot be</hi> juſtified; becauſe who ever truly loves, is ever <hi>afraid</hi> to offend his beloved: Fourthly, this <hi>fear</hi> is worldly or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, ſuch as men have to looſe their eſtates, or friends affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, when to preſerve theſe temporal trifles they hazard the loſſe of eternal bleſſings: Fifthly, this <hi>fear</hi> is ſcruple, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as perfect charity abandons all ſcruples, and proceeds freely and frankly in her Actions according to that of St. Paul, Rom. 8.15. <hi>You have not received the ſpirit of ſervitude again in fear, but the spirit of adoption of ſons, wherein we cry Abba, Father:</hi> Laſtly, Charity baniſheth all <hi>fear</hi> of puniſhment, although it allowes <hi>fear</hi> of the fault, that may deſerve puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the ſoules in Purgatory are not troubled at their pains ſo much, as they are to have deſerved them by their faults, which they are even willing to expiate: ſo when he concludes this verſe, ſaying, <hi>fear hath pain,</hi> he means <hi>fear</hi> in theſe ſenſes as above; ſuch as is ſaid of war, that the fear of war, is worſe then war it ſelf; and all <hi>fear</hi> which brings <hi>pain</hi> is oppoſite to charity, that brings eaſe and content along with it, not ſolicitude, nor anxiety, which ſhuts up mens hearts, whereas <hi>perfect charity</hi> opens and dilates them.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. 20. 21. Theſe three laſt verſes are as it were recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory and winding up the clew or threed of this amorous diſcourſe, which lead us into the delightful maze of love, and hath brought us out again, according as we heard in the expoſition of the ſixteenth verſe; adding here, it is not only a counſel, but a command from God, that we <hi>love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi> that we <hi>love our neighbour,</hi> leſt men ſhould pretend it were enough to love God onely: whereas indeed all the ſcope of St. John in this Epiſtle hath been to draw us to a love of one another, by ſhewing how God hath loved us all without reſpect of perſons, and taught us to <hi>love</hi> even our
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:204830:337"/> enemies, leſt we ſhould excuſe our ſelves from that comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of perfect dilection, which is a friendly loving of our enemies, to ſhew we have no enemies at all, but our own ſins; the onely things (if we may ſo call them) that we are, or can be allowed not to love, and indeed may perfectly hate them, nay the more we do hate them, the more we ſhall love our neighbours, as finding we have no enemies of any, but of our ſelves. Note, the Evangeliſt tells us <hi>we are lyers,</hi> to ſay <hi>we love God,</hi> if <hi>we love not our Brother,</hi> becauſe love is a paſſion leading us by the eye, to the embracements of the objects that we ſee before our eyes: if therefore a man looking upon God Almighties picture, which himſelf hath made (as he confeſſeth) like himſelf, and do not love that picture which he ſees; how can he love the prototype or original thereof, God himſelf <hi>whom he ſees not?</hi> And truly the Logick of this diſcourſe is convincing, becauſe love is firſt rooted <hi>in the object ſeen;</hi> if therefore we do not <hi>love</hi> that object of God, which we do ſee, how can we without a bluſh be ſo impudent, ſo irrational, as to ſay, we love the object which <hi>we do not ſee</hi> at all? as well a blind man might tell us, he ſees and loves darkneſſe, which is nothing but a privation of ſight and light.</p>

                           <p n="36">36. WE have ſeen how <hi>perfect charity</hi> was inculcated by St. John in this dayes Epiſtle; now St. Luke begins his Goſpel in a ſtile ſuitable thereunto, when he recommends the love of our enemies, under the notion of <hi>mercy:</hi> And indeed when he bids us <hi>be merciful to one another, as our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is merciful;</hi> what elſe can he point out unto us, then the dilection of our enemies? ſince God the Father his firſt <hi>mercy</hi> was ſhewn to none elſe, but thoſe that were his utter enemies, mankind, for whoſe redemption yet he ſent his ſacred Son, a ſacrifice and a propitiation for the whole maſſe of humane nature, to ſhew the height of his <hi>perfection</hi> in this his act of <hi>mercy;</hi> which was indeed ſo great, that hence it is, his <hi>mercy</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>ſurpaſſed all his other works,</hi> Pſal. 44.9. And that we do not miſtake in expounding <hi>mercy</hi> here for love of our enemies, we may avouch St. Matthew, Chap. 5.43. who ſpeaking to the ſame ſenſe as St. Luke doth here, (though not in the ſame words) brings in our Saviour ſaying; <hi>You have heard, that it is ſaid, thou ſhalt love thy neighbour, and ſhalt hate thine enemie;</hi> &amp; v. 44. <hi>But I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for your perſecutours and thoſe that calumniate you;</hi> and v. 48. he concludes this ſubject thus, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, St. Lukes <hi>mercy</hi> here recommended, is the dilection of our enemies, and who ſo loves them, is not onely <hi>merciful,</hi> as <hi>God is mercifull,</hi> but by that means is <hi>perfect</hi> alſo, as <hi>God is perfect;</hi> in ſuch ſenſe as the Expoſitours interpret St. Matthewes <hi>perfection,</hi> and S. Lukes <hi>mercy,</hi> which are here all one, becauſe <hi>love</hi> or <hi>mercy</hi> to our enemies is indeed the very height of <hi>perfection</hi> in us; and ſo it is the greateſt, that ever did (to us) appear to be in God, if yet any of his attributes can be one greater then another. When therefore we are bid <hi>be mercifull, or perfect,</hi> as <hi>God is,</hi> we are to underſtand it thus, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are to proceed further in <hi>perfection,</hi> then all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:204830:339"/> who though they received the precept of loving their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the very law of Nature, as we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4, 5. <hi>if thou meet thine enemies Oxe or Aſſe aſtray, bring it home;</hi> yet were ſo blind as not to practiſe (indeed not to ſee) it, as appeared, when the Scribes and Doctours of the Law deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a Tradition quite oppoſite to this, teaching, (as our Saviour ſayes above) <hi>Hate your enemies:</hi> and for this reaſon to undeceive them, and to ſhew the world their errour, that had antiquated the law of nature in this particular, God himſelf makes it a ſignal mark of his <hi>perfection,</hi> and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it to us, as the height of perfection in us, above which he requires no more at our hands, and for which he likens (if not equalls) us unto himſelf in <hi>perfection.</hi> I ſay, likens us, becauſe that is the true ſenſe of this Text, bidding us <hi>love</hi> our enemies <hi>perfectly,</hi> and not ſlightly, but with all our hearts, as God loveth us, who dyed for our ſakes, that were all his enemies: and this <hi>perfection</hi> therefore is <hi>divine,</hi> not humane in us; becauſe we may bear a kind of civill reſpect of <hi>love</hi> to our enemies, and yet not love them <hi>perfectly,</hi> as God loveth us; whereby we onely attain to this divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>mercy</hi> and love, which likens us to God himſelf: And though by the firſt, 'tis true, we become Gods children in nature, by the laſt we become his children in grace; and ſo of regulated nature, make our nature ſayntified too, which gives it the finiſhing and life-colour of <hi>perfection</hi> or ſimilitude to God: though when we are greateſt Saints here, our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is but initiated, or begun; ſince here we can at moſt but curb, but tame concupiſcence, whereas in heaven it ſhall be extirpated quite and clean, and then we ſhall be <hi>perfectly perfect,</hi> as God is, while our here beginnings, ſhall be there finiſhed by the burniſh of Glory, poliſhing the works of Grace wrought in our unpoliſht natures.</p>
                           <p n="37">37. How excellently well doth this follow, ſince we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes apt to fall upon <hi>judging</hi> and <hi>condemning</hi> our enemies! Yet it is not Judiciary, but raſh <hi>Judgment,</hi> that is here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; ſince the former is the main vertue that ſupporteth government over all the world, but the latter is a vice as much
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:204830:339"/> deſtroying order, as it were to ſee the delinquent leap from the bar to the bench, and in ſtead of ſtanding to receive his own ſentence from the mouth of Juſtice, pronounce a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory ſentence on his Judge: for ſo ſhall all thoſe be to us at the latter day, whom we by our raſh Judgements here condemn of any fault, wherein they are not guilty. Now the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Judgment</hi> is an act of Juriſdiction, not onely declaring, but puniſhing of crimes; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſome Magiſtrates onely, not allowed to any that are meer ſubjects, ſuch as we all are to Almighty God, and conſequently none of us can lawfully ſit as Judge over the actions of our neigbours; no not the Prieſt himſelf out of his Confeſſionary or Tribunal Seat, where the Penitent muſt be his own accuſer too, or elſe cannot be judged by the Prieſt. The like is of <hi>condemning,</hi> as of <hi>Judgement,</hi> which ſeem to differ onely as the Judges declaration of the crime doth from the condemnation of the Criminal, by the prolation of the ſentence againſt him, and aſſignation of him over to the puniſhment of the Law, anſwerable to the Fact for which he is condemned. But why it is ſaid, <hi>Judge not, and you ſhall not be judged, Condemn not, and you ſhall not be condemned,</hi> will not eaſily be underſtood; for by this meanes no delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent would ever ſuffer, unleſſe he were ſo inſolent, as <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his Judge,</hi> (or another body guilty as himſelf:) We muſt not therefore take it in this ſenſe, but rather thus; <hi>Judge not</hi> falſly of another, and you ſhall not be condemned of ſuch falſe <hi>judgement; Condemn</hi> not your neighbour falſly, and God will not <hi>condemn</hi> you for that particular guilt of falſe condemnation; or, make the beſt interpretation of other mens actions, and God will make the beſt of yours alſo, when he comes your Judge. Yet we have an excellent example in the Adultereſſe, eſcaping even the juſt ſentence of the old law, by our Saviours bidding thoſe that were without ſin, to caſt the firſt ſtone at her, whereby every man ſlunk away, and none was left to execute that ſevere law upon her: and ſure, it is to this example the Evangeliſt alludes, when he forbids raſh <hi>Judgement</hi> in us, under the notion of our own being to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:204830:340"/> come to Judgement alſo, and of our hope to eſcape well at the dread Tribunal of Almighty God, if we endeavour to clear our own ſeen conſciences, rather then paſſe a Judgement upon the unſeen ſins of others. But the cloſe of this verſe puts a period to this difficulty: Admit others do offend God, or you, yet <hi>judge</hi> them not, <hi>condemn</hi> them not, <hi>forgive</hi> rather on your parts, and by this means you ſhall obtain from God forgiveneſſe of your offences to his Divine Majeſty. O who would not forgive a trivial fault in hope to gain thereby a pardon for his own haynous offences?</p>
                           <p n="38">38. <hi>Give you</hi> temporal almes, <hi>and you ſhall have given to you</hi> ſpiritual treaſures; not onely according to the ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of your gift, but according to the <hi>good meaſure</hi> of God, whoſe hand is alwayes full, and who never gives his gifts to halfes, but doth <hi>preſſe down</hi> his graces <hi>upon us,</hi> and <hi>ſhakes</hi> a world of his <hi>favours together,</hi> even untill they <hi>run over;</hi> and inables us to ſpare others part of his holy gifts to us, whileſt his Divine Majeſty pleaſeth to make ſinful men, inſtruments of ſanctity in others. And that for temporall Almes we receive ſpiritual treaſures, the following words of this verſe declare; ſaying, thoſe abundant proportions ſhall <hi>he given into your own boſomes,</hi> (which are the Veſſels of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual gifts and graces, as other mens hands are the receptacles of our temporal Almes:) and what followes tells us, that according <hi>to the meaſure</hi> of our Almes we ſhall receive a <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of graces; for little almes a little grace; though in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of temporal gifts with thoſe that are ſpiritual, the leaſt grace is a <hi>preſſed, ſhaken, running over meaſure</hi> in reſpect of a little almes: if therefore our almes be great, by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the graces proportionable thereunto, will be infinite, which is in part declared, when we are told, <hi>charity covers a multitude of ſinnes.</hi> So the ſum of this verſe is to exhort us to giving almes, according as we will hope for our own ſins to be forgiven, and for the grace of God (covering our ſins) to make us able to ſanctifie others, whileſt we adde to our temporal almes an addition of ſpiritual inſtruction, both by the exemplarity of our lives, and by our teaching the ignorant
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:204830:340"/> (if need be) their duty towards Almighty God; as this leſſon we ſhall alwayes teach when we give Almes, that 'tis God who gives, while our purſes are open to the relieving of the poore, ſince <hi>God hath placed the portion of the poore in the rich mans hands.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="39">39. This <hi>ſimilitude</hi> was here aptly introduced, becauſe it is alluding to that which went before of raſh <hi>Judgement</hi> one againſt an other; ſince it is the part of a Judge to be himſelf clear of all the faults he condemns others of; to be indeed the eye of the people, (or rather ever in the peoples eyes) ſo they will never run in danger of the Law, but follow the conduct of their leading Judge in the part of Innocence and Juſtice: But if they will take upon them to be Judges of other mens actions, then they put out, as it were, their own eyes, and <hi>become blind guides</hi> of others, and conſequently <hi>both fall into the ditch</hi> of danger, if not into the bottomleſſe pit of hell fire.</p>
                           <p n="40">40. This <hi>ſimile</hi> followes fitly upon the former, for as a <hi>guide</hi> is a kind of <hi>maſter,</hi> (in the way he guideth others,) ſo if the <hi>guide</hi> be <hi>blind,</hi> the <hi>guided</hi> who follows not ſo much in vertue of his own eyes, as in belief of his guides knowledge, muſt needs periſh in that truſt repoſed in his guide, if the guide doe periſh miſſing his way, by his own blindneſſe. So a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in that art he undertakes to teach, muſt needs be ſuppoſed better verſed then any of his <hi>ſchollars</hi> are in the ſame Art; for ſo long as he is able to teach, <hi>he is a maſter,</hi> and ſo long as others learn they are <hi>ſchollars;</hi> and conſequently in this ſenſe, <hi>no ſchollar</hi> (as he is a ſchollar, or a learner) can know more <hi>then his maſter;</hi> all which notwithſtanding abſolutely ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the man that is at firſt but a <hi>ſchollar</hi> in an Art, may arrive at laſt to a perfection in that Art much above his <hi>maſter,</hi> but this muſt be by his own better induſtry, or by ſome other great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er helps, then any his <hi>maſter</hi> was able to afford him; and then he is no <hi>ſchollar</hi> (as to that particular wherein he excells his <hi>maſter</hi>) but rather his <hi>maſter</hi> may (in that) become his <hi>ſchollar:</hi> So when it is ſaid <hi>every one ſhall be perfect, if he be as his master,</hi> it is underſtood, in that which the <hi>maſter</hi> can
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:204830:341"/> teach, and wherein the <hi>ſchollar</hi> was to learn, not in any other particular. And truly this place is a good incitement towards humility, in thoſe who think themſelves <hi>grand maſters</hi> and knowing men, for even ſuch may ſtoop to learn ſome ſpeciall truths or experiments of far leſſe knowing, or leſſe experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced men then themſelves; and in theſe ſmaller acquiſitions the greater men muſt be content, not onely to learn, but even to eſteem they acquire a kind of perfection, by what they have thus learned, from thoſe who in other matters are hugely their inferiours.</p>
                           <p n="41">41. Here the Apoſtle lookes back to the <hi>raſh judgement</hi> he had before forbidden; as who ſhould ſay, why doſt thou cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>judge,</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> little faults in thy neighbour, being thy ſelf guilty of farre greater? Is this <hi>mercy?</hi> is this <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</hi> is <hi>this to love thine enemies?</hi> no, it is to tyrannize over thy friends, who give thee better example then thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweſt, though they are not themſelves free from fault: For by the <hi>more</hi> and <hi>beam</hi> are here underſtood the faults on both ſides; the <hi>mote</hi> being the little fault in one mans <hi>eye,</hi> raſhly <hi>judged</hi> of by him that hath <hi>a beam,</hi> a greater mote, or fault in his own <hi>eye.</hi> And this example was well made <hi>in the eye,</hi> which never ſees it ſelf, but is alwayes looking upon other objects, and cenſuring them for deformed or beautifull, according as they pleaſe <hi>the eye:</hi> juſt ſo do thoſe who judge raſhly of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and never caſt <hi>an eye</hi> into their own conſciences. And ſince we are apteſt ſtill to be thus raſh over enemies; therefore the <hi>perfection of charity</hi> was under the notion of <hi>mercy</hi> premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, before this ſubject of <hi>raſh judgement</hi> was fallen upon by the Evangeliſt.</p>
                           <p n="42">42. The Evangeliſt neatly winds up all the bottome of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (this day intended to us) upon the button of <hi>mercy,</hi> which then lieth ſmootheſt, when it is ſhewed towards our enemies; and then indeed we ſhew both <hi>mercy</hi> to them, and diſcretion towards our ſelves, when we ſpare cenſuring their little faults, by introſpection into our own much greater: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we run upon impoſſibilities, when we pretend to ſee <hi>moats in other mens eyes,</hi> that have <hi>beams in our own,</hi> which take
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:204830:341"/> away all our ſight from us; and therefore in this verſe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt askes <hi>how we can</hi> with any front or confidence go to <hi>looke moats in our neighbours eyes,</hi> that <hi>have beames in our own?</hi> The intent of this queſtion is to make us abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear all <hi>raſh judgement,</hi> ſince we ſee the ſight of our own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is quite taken from us, by our irrationall treſpaſſes againſt the Law of God; for upon the matter, every ſinne is an act againſt nature, becauſe it propends to the nothing, out of which our nature was educed, when we were created to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes doing ſomething in honour and glory of our Creatour. And leaſt we ſhould not apprehend the Evangeliſt to be in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, when he beats down this common errour of the world, this correcting others in things we are our ſelves more faulty in then they, this tyrannizing over our enemies by taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their ſmall faults; he calls it plain <hi>hypocriſie</hi> in us to go about cenſuring any body elſe, untill we have purged our ſelves of all faults, eſpecially of all that are greater then thoſe, we <hi>hypocritically</hi> reprehend in others; as if we were free from any ſuch, who yet abound in many far greater then they are which we rebuke our neighbour for. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, by this Art the Evangeliſt cuts off all <hi>raſh judgement</hi> for ever, ſince he <hi>forbids</hi> it till we have leſſe faults then thoſe we find in others; which no pious ſoul will ever <hi>judge</hi> of it ſelf, and conſequently ſhe will forbear all <hi>raſh judgement,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly practiſed upon our enemies (under the mask of <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> to rectifie their errours) then we ſhall hope we may begin to <hi>love</hi> them, when we ſee we muſt not reprehend them raſhly, as for the moſt part men are prone to do. So adding theſe inſtructions of <hi>perfect dilection</hi> which the Goſpel affords, to the former given us in the Epiſtle, the doctrin proves compleat; and we (if <hi>perfect</hi> in it) ſhall hope to be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as God is perfect,</hi> who ſent us his ſacred Son to <hi>perfect</hi> us in ſuch heavenly doctrine, as this is.</p>

                           <p>WIth great reaſon this Prayer begs that we may equally <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>love the name of God,</hi> ſince it is a Prayer as well adapted to the day of our Lord, (being the ſecond Sunday after Pentecoſt) as unto the now flowing Feaſt of the Bleſſed Sacrament, in the Octaves whereof we are at preſent: And ſince all Sundayes are dayes ſet apart for the ſervice of God, we do moſt properly on this day pray, that we may ever ſayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his holy <hi>name</hi> with <hi>equal fear</hi> and <hi>love</hi> unto the ſame: which is as much as to ſay, we ſhould never receive the Bleſſed Sacrament (now expoſed in all Churches where Catholick Religion is freely practiſed) but that we ſhould as well have a regard to the <hi>fear</hi> we ought to have of Chriſt our <hi>Judge,</hi> as to the <hi>love</hi> we ought to bear to the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> our Lord and Saviour; who is moſt properly ſo called now, becauſe in the Bleſſed Sacrament, we are in a manner actually ſaved, by having heaven come down to us, even before we are able or fit to go up to heaven: And therefore this prayer beggs, we may as <hi>equally</hi> at leaſt, <hi>love</hi> God under his beſt of <hi>names,</hi> (that of <hi>Jeſus</hi>) by which he is now expoſed unto us in the B. Sacrament; as we muſt <hi>fear</hi> him under his ſeverer name of our <hi>Judge,</hi> if we now fail of ſuch <hi>equall love</hi> unto him. O happy Chriſtians! who at the ſame time when they are bid to <hi>fear Chriſt,</hi> are taught to <hi>love Jeſus;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> muſt be as <hi>equal,</hi> as Chriſt Jeſus is to Jeſus Chriſt. But the reaſon why we beg this <hi>equality</hi> of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:204830:343"/> 
                              <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>love</hi> is, becauſe <hi>Chriſt doth never leave deſtitute</hi> of <hi>his government, thoſe whom he inſtructs in the ſolidity of his love,</hi> that is, Chriſt our Judge will ſweetly rule us, if he find we do <hi>ſolidly love him:</hi> and we were laſt Sunday taught the <hi>ſolidity of that love</hi> did conſiſt in loving God above all things, and not only our <hi>neighbour,</hi> but alſo our <hi>enemies</hi> as our <hi>ſelves:</hi> which leſſon was then given as a preparative to this Feaſt now flowing in the Octaves thereof; and alluded unto in this prayer, teaching us in brief, what the Epiſtle and Goſpel tell us more at large: The firſt, that who <hi>loves not,</hi> ought to <hi>ſtand in fear</hi> of that <hi>death which he abides in by not loving:</hi> Nay more, ſo confident muſt our <hi>Love</hi> be, that we muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not <hi>fear</hi> to dye for our neighbour, then we muſt dare not to love him: and to this we are incited by the example of Chriſt, whoſe love made him dye for us, that were his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Again, we are told this <hi>love</hi> muſt be real and true, not verbal onely; and that it cannot be ſo, if we relieve not our neighbour in his neceſſity, when we are able ſo to do: This argues indeed, that we are not <hi>left deſtitute by our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour Chriſt Jeſus, who inſtructs us in this ſolidity of love</hi> from one end of the Epiſtle to the other. And ſince it is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent of all Expoſitours, that the <hi>Supper</hi> mentioned in this dayes Goſpel is a figure of the Bleſſed Sacrament; ſure that is a myſtery as full of <hi>ſolid love,</hi> as is expreſſed in the Prayer above, teaching us never to go unto this <hi>Supper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out equal fear and love:</hi> and ſo the Prayer ſtands excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well adapted both to the Sunday, to the Feaſt, to the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and to the Goſpel of the day: For if we can, by ſaying this prayer fervently, obtain the <hi>equal fear and love</hi> which it petitioneth; aſſuredly in recompenſe thereof, Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God will ſo <hi>govern us,</hi> as we ſhall not for humane ends <hi>excuſe</hi> our ſelves from our duties to his Divine Majeſty; but ſhall <hi>come</hi> ſo religiouſly to the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, as we need not fear being ſhut out at the laſt <hi>Supper</hi> of eternall reſt in glory, which again the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours will have the Sacramentall <hi>Supper</hi> to be a ſigne of.

                           <p n="13">13. THe Evangeliſt had in the precedent verſes told us the difference between the children of God, and thoſe of the devil; and how there was mortal enmity between the one and the other, inſtancing in Cain killing his Brother Abel, for no other cauſe then envy to him, ſeeing the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:204830:344"/> of Abel was acceptable to God, and his was not; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Abel was a child of God, and Cain a child of the devil, and ſo no marvel if his offerings were not acceptable to God Almighty: But the Apoſtle proceeds further, and bids Chriſtians not wonder, <hi>if the world hate them</hi> becauſe of their good deeds, ſince, for that reaſon Cain (repreſenting the malignancy of the world) <hi>hated</hi> Abel, who was a figure of a good Chriſtian, offering grateful ſacrifice to God: beſides, the Apoſtle here alludes to what he had ſaid in his Goſpel, Chap. 15.18. <hi>If the world hate you, know it hated me before it hated you;</hi> and therefore here he concludes, they ſhould rather expect, then <hi>wonder</hi> at it, if they found the world did <hi>hate</hi> them, ſince no Son can hope for love from him who <hi>hates</hi> his Father; and the foregoing Verſes of this Epiſtle were all upon our happy filiation with God. But we may obſerve the cauſes remarkable, why the wicked (for thoſe are underſtood <hi>by the world,</hi> ſo called from the greater part thereof, that are wicked indeed) do <hi>hate</hi> thoſe who are good: The firſt is, the diſſimilitude betwixt vice and vertue, which begets a <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi> as ſimilitude begets love and affection: for we ſee all worldlings puffed up with pride and ambition; contrariwiſe all good Chriſtians are meek and humble. The ſecond is Envy; for wicked men ſeeing they cannot arrive at purity and ſanctity, envy thoſe who do attain thereunto. The third, becauſe the good men do further reprehend the vices of the wicked, as the holy Ghoſt doth inſpire them, in imitation of his example, whoſe coming <hi>ſhall argue the world of ſin,</hi> as we heard, <hi>John</hi> 15.8. The fourth, becauſe the world ſees good men flye the company of the wicked. The laſt, becauſe their affections are contrary, one doating upon the world altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the other wholly inamoured on Almighty God; ſo they muſt needs be as oppoſite, as two Contraries are, as heat to cold, as dry to moiſt, and labour to overcome each other; but with this difference, that the good man labours the converſion of the bad, the bad man indeavours the perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the good.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. The Apoſtle doth not here ſay <hi>we know</hi> by any divine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:204830:345"/> Faith, or certain knowledge, as hereticks will needs interpret this place; but onely by moral certitude, <hi>we know,</hi> that if <hi>we love one another for Gods ſake,</hi> we muſt needs love God much more; and, as by ſin againſt him we dye, ſo by love of him we deteſt ſin, and are by that meanes <hi>tranſlated from the death</hi> of ſin, to <hi>the life</hi> of grace in this world, and <hi>to the life</hi> of glory in the next. So that all the certitude we have of this, is the teſtimony of our own conſciences, telling us we are not guilty of any defect either in our love to God, or to our neighbour: Yet becauſe St. Paul, 1 Cor. 4. v. 4. no ſooner ſaid <hi>he was not guilty,</hi> then he added <hi>yet in this I am not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi> the Catholick Church teacheth our aſſurance of our being in the ſtate of grace is onely moral, not divine. And three ſignes there are of Juſtifying grace inhabiting within us: The firſt, if we perfectly hate ſin; The ſecond, if we mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the fleſh; The third, if we have zeal to our neighbours good, ſuch as St. Paul had, ſaying, <hi>Who is ſick, and I am not diſtempered with him alſo?</hi> 2 Cor. 11. inſomuch, that here St. John preſumes to ſay, <hi>he that loves not, remaines in death;</hi> that is, if when he is bound to ſhew his love either to God, or his neighbour, he doth it not, <hi>he remaines in death,</hi> in the guilt at leaſt of that paſt ſin which he committed, by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to do his duty when he was bound to do it; out of which guilt ſince there is no going but by the help of grace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid to <hi>remain in death,</hi> untill by an Act of love he revives from <hi>the death</hi> of that guilt, which he <hi>remained in</hi> by not loving, when he was bound to do it; Nay, <hi>the death</hi> of our body is but a ſhadow of <hi>death,</hi> to that of our ſoules; ſo the Apoſtle needs not ſcruple to ſay, men living in ſin <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in death,</hi> becauſe they are truly <hi>dead</hi> to grace and glory, as long as they continue in their ſin, be they never ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:204830:345"/> him that coveting his neighours wife is an Adulterer in will, though not in fact. Yet others will have this <hi>hatred</hi> to be onely murder in diſpoſition, not reduced into act; but <hi>who ſo loves danger ſhall periſh in it;</hi> and therefore to dally in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions is to indanger at leaſt periſhing in them. Let no man wonder the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, <hi>he that murdereth hath not life everlaſting in him,</hi> when he that is in this world freeſt from all ſinne, hath not here <hi>everlaſting life abiding</hi> in him: whence it follows, by <hi>life everlaſting</hi> is here underſtood that life of grace, whereunto <hi>everlaſting life</hi> and glory is due; whereof none can have ſo much as a hope, ſo long as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in hatred or murder as above.</p>

Not content to inſtance in leſſe then the higheſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Apoſtle here tells us, what is perfect charity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect dilection; <hi>to lay down our lives</hi> for our neighbours ſouls, as Chriſt did his for ours: But not ſo as we can looſe our ſpirituall life, to gain the like life to our neighbour; no this is againſt the rule of charity, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ever regards it ſelf: but reſerving our ſpirituall, we may looſe our temporall lives to gain our neighbours ſouls. And not onely may, but are here exhorted thereunto, if we ſay commanded, the text will bear it, in caſe we ſee our neighbours ſoul in danger, unleſſe we venture our lives. And in ſome caſes men may, and are bound to hazzard at leaſt their own, to ſave anothers life: as firſt, a ſouldier may rather chooſe to die in the place, then yield to his enemy the advantage of that ground his commander truſted him to defend; the like is of a citizen in defenſe of the whole city, (for the part is not of equall regard with the whole) ſo Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did, as we reade, Judg. 16. who oppreſſed himſelf with the ruine of a houſe, thereby to oppreſſe the Philiſtines alſo, and to ſave the people of God from their captivity: and though they are not many examples of obligation, yet we have many of election, ſhewing divers have died to ſave the life of their friend, divers have rendered themſelves captive to redeem others from bondage, divers have loſt their lives to preſerve the chaſtity of others, as eſteeming the life of grace in their neighbour more pretious, then that of nature in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

Having ſhewed in the precedent verſe, that we are bound in ſome caſes to poure out our blouds for our neighbours; no marvell if here it be concluded, <hi>he cannot have charity who ſeeing his neighbour in neceſſity, ſhuts up the bowels of his mercy from him, and will not allow him any relief.</hi> And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is ſo uſuall a thing, therefore to confound thoſe who have ſuch ſtony hearts, the Text compells them to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing the leſſer, upon all occaſions, by ſhewing before, they were obliged to a much greater act of charity, upon ſome particular emergencies: as who ſhould ſay, though it be hard to lay down your life for another, yet it muſt be eaſie to lay down your purſe, or ſome equivalent relief, if you will merit the name of a Chriſtian, and give proof by your acts of mercy, that the authour of mercy is within you, and that your ſelf do live ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, by relieving your neighbour corporally: Whence moſt Divines hold, a man is bound in conſcience to give alms more or leſſe, and that not onely in extream, but even in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reall neceſſities; as of meat, drink, clothing, houſing, or the like, grounded in that of Eccleſ. chap. 4. v. 1. <hi>Child, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud not the poor man of that Alms, which is due unto him from thee:</hi> for indeed the portion of the poor is in the rich mans hands, and God gives riches, to the end rich men may have the merit of poverty by giving their goods away, and poor men the benefit of riches, by what they receive out of the ſurplus of others. And becauſe it is too long for my preſent purpoſe to inlarge upon this point, I referre the reader to the fourth book of <hi>Salvianus</hi> dedicated to the Catholick Church; wherein he ſhews how great a ſinne it is for Church-men to inrich their kindred with the Churches treaſure; and for rich perſons of the world to ſtarve Chriſt in the perſons of the poor, while they feaſt the devil in the exceſſes of the rich, by leaving their eſtates to ſuch, as will not make at leaſt pious uſes thereof. I do heartily therefore recommend this Authour to all thoſe rich perſons, who find fleſh and bloud prevail more in them, then pietie to the poor; for if I be not much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they will thank me to have done this charity to them, who thought perhaps they did not ſtand in need thereof, but
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:204830:346"/> their minds may be other after reading the ſolid pietie of this learned Authour <hi>Salvianus</hi> upon this particular ſubject.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. Lo here the <hi>word</hi> is oppoſed to the <hi>work,</hi> the <hi>tongue</hi> to <hi>truth,</hi> as if we did want charity, that onely gave <hi>good words</hi> to the poor without <hi>alms;</hi> or as if they wanted <hi>truth,</hi> who fed the poor with <hi>words</hi> of comfort onely, when they were able <hi>truely</hi> to ſatisfie their hunger, and would not. Not but that he is truely charitable, who inſtructing feeds the ſoul at leaſt, when he cannot feed his body; but that to do both is the duty of a Chriſtian, when both may be done, and where both are wanting. So the meaning of this text is, that our charity ought to be reall, and not verball onely, to be opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, not idle or lazy: for here the <hi>tongue</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>truth,</hi> as diſſimulation to ſincerity; and the <hi>word</hi> to the <hi>work,</hi> as empty air to a purſe full of money, or as froth is to beer or wine. To conclude, hence we are taught further, that we muſt not onely be effectually charitable, but alſo we are bound to be affectionately ſo; for it little avails to give alms, unleſſe we alſo <hi>love</hi> the poor whom we relieve, and therefore <hi>love them,</hi> becauſe we relieve Chriſt in them: and unleſſe we give thus, we ſell our ſelves for popular applauſe, by giving away our ſubſtance to purchaſe the empty air, the ſhadows of vain commends, and ſo loſe a divine bleſſing, (as to the children of God) to get a morall one, as to be eſteemed humane fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the world.</p>

                           <p n="16">16. THis parable is almoſt the ſame that was mentioned, Mat. 22.2. only there in a different way, time, and place, as under the name of a <hi>dinner;</hi> and here it is brought in under the name of a <hi>ſupper.</hi> And there are divers ſenſes made upon this <hi>ſupper.</hi> Some call it a parable of the Incarnation, life, and death of Chriſt; and thus S. Matthew ſeems to take it, calling it a <hi>dinner</hi> as to the Church militant, and a <hi>ſupper</hi> to the Church triumphant. Others apply this parable unto the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:204830:348"/> Bleſſed Sacrament; and thoſe make God the Father, maſter of this feaſt, his ſacred Sonne the feaſt it ſelf, made of his bleſſed body and bloud; and in favour of this opinion the holy Church at this time reads this Goſpel, as alluding to the flowing feaſt of <hi>Corpus Chriſti:</hi> But yet for all that the literall ſenſe of this Goſpel alludes to the <hi>laſt ſupper</hi> of heavenly glory; for that is the true <hi>ſupper,</hi> which ends the laborious day time, and begins eternall reſt that never ſhall have end: ſo, though many may be caſt out of doors after the <hi>dinner</hi> of the Church militant, yet none can be caſt out, after they once enter to this trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſupper. <q>And for that cauſe the moſt genuine ſenſe of this place alludes, as S. Gregory ſaith, hom. 36. <hi>to the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eternall ſweetneſſe and glory.</hi>
                              </q> Where note that <hi>great</hi> ſignifies here all the degrees of greatneſſe, ſuch a <hi>ſupper</hi> as none could be greater, either for the rarity of the dainties, and banquets thereof, or for the ſplendour and duration of it: whereof S. Paul 1. Cor. 2. v. 9. ſayes, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor hath ear heard, neither hath it aſcended into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> And to this <hi>ſupper</hi> he called <hi>many:</hi> by <hi>many</hi> are here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood no leſſe then even <hi>all the Jews,</hi> who were the true Church, and people of God, and were called by the Patriarchs and Prophets, by John the Baptiſt, by Chriſt himſelf, while he lived amongſt them.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. But by <hi>his ſervants</hi> whom he ſent, are properly meant the Apoſtles, left by him to convert theſe Jews as well as other nations: And by the <hi>bower of ſupper</hi> here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is underſtood the reſurrection of our Saviour; for then (and not till then) <hi>were all things ready</hi> for this <hi>great ſupper</hi> of glory, becauſe then he brought with him from his grave a multitude of bleſſed ſouls, who therefore were in Paradiſe (as he promiſed the thief to be that very day he died) becauſe they were in his impaſſible preſence, that is to ſay, when he was pleaſed to allow his body the benefit of all the gifts due to glorious bodies; ſo though they were not in the finall place of eternall reſt, untill they did aſcend with him to heaven, yet they were ſet
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:204830:348"/> at the table of glory with him, and were carried up ſitting at this feaſt, into the great preſence-chamber of the ſacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the Empyreall heaven: and after his Aſcenſion, <hi>his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> the Apoſtles went round about the world to <hi>invite</hi> more, and to tell them <hi>the great ſupper</hi> of glory was now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for all, that would go to it ſuch way as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="18">18. <hi>By all excuſing themſelves</hi> is here literally underſtood the Jewiſh nation, whoſe eye was no further bent upon reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then as they expected a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that ſhould make them all rich; ſo groſly they underſtood the heavenly riches promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as they believed them to be temporall eſtates: And therefore here the firſt excuſe is made by plea of neceſſity, to looke after worldly wealth, repreſented by the purchaſed <hi>village,</hi> which was ſaid to be newly bought by him, that was content to ſell the kingdom of heaven for a patch of earth. But Saint Gregory hom. 36. in Evang. notes the ill manners of this civility, when the excuſant ſayes, <hi>I pray thee have me excuſed;</hi> for he calls it pride in the action, though it ſeems humility in the voyce, becauſe he diſdained heaven, and preferred earth.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. The ſecond excuſe inſiſts upon an other notable addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Jewes to worldly wealth, namely their huge great ſtocks they gloried in upon their grounds; which we read A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaack, Jacob, and Job abounded in, and which were looked on as the greateſt bleſſings God could give: ſo, in regard of earthly ſtocks of Cattle, they contemned the greater ſtock of Glory in the next world. <q>But St. Gregory, in the place laſt cited, will have theſe five yoak of oxen allude to our five ſenſes diſtracting us from all heavenly objects.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p n="20">20. St. Gregory, cited as above, underſtands this place of carnall ſinne, the greateſt impediment between a ſoul and glory of all others; for here the excuſer askes no pardon, but boldly ſayes, <hi>he cannot come:</hi> it ſeems he that could not wiſh he were able, was wholly unable, as well as he was abſolutely unwilling, while he did not ſay, he would come another time,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:204830:349"/> as the former excuſes might import, but abſolutely profeſſed, <hi>he could not come;</hi> he had, ſure, as little will as power, and therefore he might have added he neither could nor would. Though others more favourably ſay, this place alludes onely to the exceſſive uſe of the lawfull marriage-bed, which then is uſed in exceſſe, when it is made a pretence to hinder us from the ſervice of Almighty God: <q>And S. Ambroſe expreſſeth much to this ſenſe in few words, ſaying, The love of earthly things is like a birdlime upon the ſpirituall wings of our ſouls, hindring her flight up to heaven. But S. Auguſtine applies theſe three excuſes to the three things, that include all ſorts of worldly pelf, concupiſcence of the fleſh, concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence of the eye, and pride of life:</q> The firſt excuſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to the pride that man had to ſee himſelf Lord of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; The ſecond to concupiſcence of the eye, to ſee a rich ſtock of cattell cover his grounds; The third to concupiſcence of the fleſh, that made this his excuſe from going to heaven, as if he did not hope for greater pleaſure there: and indeed riches and pleaſure are the chief impediments mortalls have between them and eternall bliſſe.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. This place of the Parable alludes to Chriſt ſpeaking of himſelf, as <hi>ſervant</hi> to his heavenly Father, and telling him, the Rich men of the Jewes were all ſo tranſported with the love of the world, as they gave no ear to the invitation of the eternal word, calling them to everlaſting reſt and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and that then his Father bid him apply himſelf to the poorer ſort of Jewes, which to effect was done, when S. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Chap. 21. 31. ſayes to the Phariſees, Scribes, Doctours and high Prieſts rejecting Chriſt, <hi>The Publicanes and whores ſhall go before you in the Kingdome of God;</hi> as alſo <hi>the laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt the laſt.</hi> Others think this verified in the choyce Chriſt made of Fiſher-men for his Apoſtles, and of other poor Mechanicks, rather then of Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. <hi>God choſe the infirm things of this world, to confound all the ſtrength thereof,</hi> and <hi>fooles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found wiſe men;</hi> and this to encourage the moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures on the earth, to aym at as great riches, as heaven
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:204830:349"/> can afford, if they live according to the rule and law of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. And here our Saviour urgeth his heavenly Father, ſince all the poor people amongſt the Jewes are not able to fill up the Court of heaven, that as yet there may be more invited: and then he went aſide from the Jewes to the Samaritans and Gentiles, converting them, and ſo inviting of them to his heavenly Glory, which is the <hi>Supper</hi> here ſpoken of.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. But we are here to note, that Chriſt looked upon theſe Gentiles, in reſpect of his beloved people the Jewes, as he would do upon men that have no poor beeings in Townes or Villages, but are forced to ſhelter themſelves under the banks on high wayes, and to covet the loane of hedges for their ſhelter from winds and weather: and therefore being himſelf after his reſurrection to aſcend to heaven, he ſent his Apoſtles over all the world to find out ſuch poor Gentiles as theſe, who in reſpect of the Jewes were not held worthy (in Gods ſight) to be eſteemed as Maſters of Townes, Villages, or houſes, but were like vagabonds; yet theſe not filling heaven neither, ſee how he makes proviſion for relapſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians alſo, as men equally miſerable with ſuch vagabonds; and thoſe he will have by Eccleſiaſtical cenſures, nay by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal lawes to be even compelled or forced to return to their belief again: which yet is not a courſe uſed to any but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Chriſtians, ſuch as once were in the lap of the true Church by holy Baptiſme; and they indeed, as having once been children and Subjects of the mother Church of Chriſt, may (upon revolt) be compelled back again, whereas Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Jewes, or Infidels cannot be thus forced by penal lawes, but muſt (in a ſweet way) be gained to a right belief through perſwaſion, not compulſion.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. This verſe is onely the excluding thoſe from eternal glory, who being <hi>invited</hi> to it, will not leave temporal ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and pleaſures to purchaſe the Kingdome of heaven, but willingly wallow in the mire of worldly wealth, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:204830:350"/> then they will leave that, to enjoy eternal felicity and glory.</p>

AS this Goſpel in the ſenſe of the Expoſitours alludes to the Bleſſed Sacrament; (whoſe Feaſt is now flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) ſo is it fit we ſhould obſerve therein ſuch leſſons as we are bound to learn and put in execution for our more worthy receiving: which we may for brevity ſake reduce to two; the one a reverential awe, or <hi>holy fear</hi> of unworthineſſe; the other a fervent act of <hi>love and charity;</hi> becauſe in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is not onely the body and bloud of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, but the Majeſty and power of Almighty God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all the three perſons of the B.

                           <p n="2">2. Again, ſince it was an act of the higheſt <hi>wiſdome</hi> (the ſecond Perſon of the B.

                           <p n="3">3.

                           </p>
                           <p n="7">7. It were an injury to Gods goodneſſe for us to <hi>caſt</hi> about for that which God himſelf takes <hi>care for,</hi> that is, our ſoules good; the <hi>care</hi> of that is his, and our rule of that is by him laid unto us; ſo in that affayre we have rather to do what is commanded already, then to be <hi>ſolicitous</hi> about it, as if it were not done: And to be <hi>ſolicitous</hi> of Temporals is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian <hi>care,</hi> and therefore often forbidden in point of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; however tolerated in regard of humane infirmity: but moderate care is alwayes allowed Chriſtians in order to Temporals, when anxious ſolicitude is forbidden them, by many texts of holy writ.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. <hi>Sobriety</hi> is the beſt companion of <hi>watchfulneſſe,</hi> and therefore both are recommended: And becauſe our <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe</hi> is to be perpetual, therefore our <hi>ſobriety</hi> muſt be ſo too; but eſpecially towards night, when our hearts onely are to keep the watch, whileſt our ſenſes are aſleep; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the devil is then moſt buſie in temptations, when men are leaſt able to reſiſt, having, as it were, but their <hi>wiſh</hi> awake, and their <hi>will</hi> aſleep: hence all ſpiritual men recommend temperance towards bed-time both in meat and drink: hence the <hi>Completory</hi> begins alwayes with this very verſe, to put us in mind with what purity we ought to go to bed; having our profeſt enemy alwayes awake, and ready <hi>to devour us,</hi> if he find us off our ſober guard.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Happy we that by the leaſt <hi>reſiſtance</hi> are ſure of victory againſt this ravenous devil; for maugre all his malice, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:204830:353"/> all his power, he cannot hurt us, unleſſe we yeeld our conſents to his Temptations. Here is added, that we muſt <hi>ſtoutly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him,</hi> and <hi>believing</hi> too, becauſe ſo we get compleat victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for by <hi>reſiſtance</hi> we overcome him, by <hi>fortitude</hi> we bind him captive, by <hi>Faith</hi> we take away all his armes and power, that is, by <hi>firm, ſtout, and conſtant Faith.</hi> And again, our <hi>reſiſtance</hi> will have the more force, becauſe of what followes in this verſe: we never are left alone, but have alwayes our <hi>fellow</hi> Souldiers to help us in this Fight againſt our enemy, who never tempts us alone, but all other good men at the ſame time, and we have ſhare in their greater reſiſtance, by adding what our weakneſſe is able to do.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. This next verſe comes yet more home to our comfort and aſſiſtance, telling us, beſides the help of our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we have the help of our omnipotent Creatour againſt this enemy of mankind; <hi>the God of all grace,</hi> who having <hi>called us to everlasting glory,</hi> will not (if we help our ſelves) permit the devill to ſnatch us away into his kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſo that being deſigned for <hi>glory,</hi> we cannot fear the want of grace, for that is the ſeed, and glory the fruit of Gods goodneſſe in us. O who ſeeing how much Chriſt <hi>ſuffered</hi> to purchaſe us patience, would not gladly ſuffer this <hi>little</hi> we are told muſt be indured, if we will hope for victory? Let us therefore with the ſame zeal begin to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> as we would deſire the happy end of it, which is aſſured victory and glory.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. This laſt verſe minds us that the victory is Gods, and the honour of it his, though the reward (by his mercy) be our eternall glory too.</p>

This may minde us, that all mankind was once this <hi>loſt ſheep,</hi> brought home upon Chriſts ſhoulders when he carried his Croſſe upon them, and was crucified beſides, leaving the nine quires of Angels (repreſenting the <hi>ninetie nine juſt</hi>) in the <hi>deſert</hi> of admiration, to ſee their God ſo loſt, (in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts) to finde out us that were indeed truely loſt, and ſtrayed into the very jawes of hell and damnation; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought us home, deſires all his Angells to joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate with him: <hi>Note</hi> that, as if his joy conſiſted in our ſalvation.

And when he ſayes, that <hi>in heaven there ſhall be more joy at the converſion of this ſinner,</hi> (the ſalvation of a man <hi>doing penance</hi>) then at the perſeverance of <hi>ninetie nine juſt,</hi> he inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, the angels have a new actuall content in the penance and ſaintity of man, which being new ſeems greater then what they had before for all good men: one reaſon is, becauſe in every
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:204830:355"/> man that is by penance ſaved, they find their own loſſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and the places of the fallen angels filled: But the main reaſon is, becauſe they ſee the will of God in this fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and they are in perfect conformity to his ſacred will.</p>
                           <p n="8">8, 9, 10. By the ſecond <hi>parable,</hi> the Rhemiſts ſay is meant holy Church, <hi>lighting</hi> up <hi>her candle</hi> of new Miſſionaries and Preachers to find out the loſt ſoul, that hereſie hath pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and having regained, <hi>found</hi> the ſoul again, invites her Prieſts to a congratulation with her. <q>But S. Gregory hom. 34. thus explicates both the <hi>parables,</hi> ſaying; Chriſt is as well meant by the <hi>woman,</hi> as by the <hi>Pastour;</hi> For as he was God, he was the wiſdome of God; and becauſe upon money there is printed an image, the <hi>woman,</hi> ſaith he, loſt her groat, when man who was created to the image of God, by ſinne left to be like his Creatour; but the <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lighted her lanthorn,</hi> becauſe the wiſedome of God appeared in humane nature, for a lanthorn ſignifies a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle lighted in it, and the light ſignifies the divinity in mans nature: The lanthorn being <hi>lighted,</hi> the woman <hi>ſwept her houſe,</hi> for ſtraight as the divinity ſhined through fleſh, mans conſcience was then ſtrooken; and the houſe is ſwept, when by reflexion the guilt of any mans conſcience is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in regard an evill mind (if it be not before by fear altered) is never purged from accuſtomary vices: The houſe then being ſwept <hi>the groat is found,</hi> ſince whileſt mans conſcience is troubled, the image of God is repaired in him: And who are the friends and neighbors, but thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall powers above mentioned, that are ſo much nearer the ſupream wiſdome, by how much more they approximate unto it through the grace of their perpetuall viſion of it? The <hi>woman</hi> therefore had <hi>ten groats,</hi> becauſe there are nine orders of Angels; and that the number of the elect might be filled, the tenth, man, was created, who was not quite loſt from his Creatour by his ſin, becauſe the eternall wiſdome ſhining through humane fleſh, found him out by the light in the ſocket of his lanthorn. Thus he. What more patheticall! what more rare!</q>

                           <p n="1">1 AS it is evident the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> here mentioned, wanted <hi>charitie</hi> whileſt they grumbled at our Saviours converſation with <hi>Publicans and ſinners;</hi> ſo is it manifeſt that it was an act of higheſt <hi>charity</hi> in our Saviour to ſeek the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of thoſe <hi>ſinners</hi> by his converſation with them; and conſequently, while our Lord goes before us with the flame of <hi>charity,</hi> we are taught to light all our works this day, at that heavenly fire.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place, theſe following <hi>Parables</hi> of the <hi>lost ſheep,</hi> and of the <hi>lost groat,</hi> tell us we are to bring up in the rere of <hi>charity</hi> (as we march along the deſert of this world) <hi>the zeal of ſouls:</hi> for though this be a vertue principally proper to Paſtors &amp; miſſionary Prieſts, yet in regard there is no ſtate of life in this world ſo deſolate wherein men are not bound to have ſome care of others, as well as of themſelves, (if it be but to edifie and lead them on by their exemplarity of life) therefore every lay-man ought more or leſſe to zeal his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſoul, and to contribute towards the ſaving of it, in ſome ſort or other; though with intermiſſion of his own devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if the neighbour require his charitable aſſiſtance, at that time when he would elſe be at his prayers.</p>

                           <p>TWo things, beloved, we aske in this prayer; <hi>a peaceable flowing of the courſe of this world,</hi> and an <hi>unperturbed devotion in the Church.</hi> O that we all had our deſires in this! or rather that we did all truely deſire and pray for it! doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we ſhould then have it; ſince holy Church we ſee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feinedly petitions it, while by this dayes ſervice ſhe exhorts
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:204830:357"/> us to do the like. And truly one main reaſon why we apply not our ſelves to a <hi>ſtill devotion</hi> in the Church, is becauſe we are neither at peace with one another in the world, nor are content to let things flow in that channell, which God hath ordered them to glide in; but are ever ſtriving to have all things go, as we our ſelves deſire: For what Chriſtian lives that hath not ſome grudge or other with his neighbour? to ſay nothing of all the Chriſtian Princes now at warres among themſelves, leaving the Turk and other Infidels to incroach upon them, to perturb <hi>the quiet devotion of the Church,</hi> and laugh us all to ſcorn beſides. But it remains to ſhew how this prayer exhauſts the Epiſtle and Goſpel of the Maſſe to day. The Epiſtle tells us, what order Almighty God hath ſet the world in; and this prayer beggs, <hi>the ſame courſe may flow peaceably,</hi> according as God hath ordered it; that is to ſay, neither one man ſhould jarre with another, nor thoſe other <hi>creatures,</hi> which God hath <hi>ſubjected</hi> to man ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at their <hi>ſubjection.</hi> And I would to God man kept his courſe as <hi>peaceably</hi> as all other creatures under him do theirs: I would to God, he did as reſignedly undergo thoſe little ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings he is here ſubjected unto, as they deſerve to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, in hope of the huge reward they are to have, if patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and <hi>peaceably</hi> endured: ſee how to day we pray, that we may do this. What prayer then more ſuitable to this Epiſtle? The Goſpel tells us, how ſweetly Jeſus Chriſt founded his Church to day upon the perſons of the Apoſtles, whom he calls to be the pillars thereof: It tells us with what devotion S. Peter followed the firſt call of our Saviour; it ſhews what miracles accompanied the Apoſtles being called to this mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; it declares with what <hi>peaceable</hi> piety they followed our Saviour, and left <hi>all</hi> they had in the world to dedicate themſelves to his devotion: What elſe doth the prayer to day cloſe withall, then a petition, that the ſame miraculous Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Church may be continued by a like miraculous preſervation of it, in the ſelf <hi>ſame quiet and peace</hi> of piety, as it was inſtituted with? (for it is indeed a miracle to ſee it ſo preſerved; nor is the goodneſſe of God leſſe ſeen in this, then
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:204830:357"/> in the other) and thereby ſhews that this is not a prayer of one day; but ought to continue and be the inceſſant prayer of holy Church unto the worlds end, that ſo it may appear to be the ſame ſweet Spouſe of Chriſt in the end, which it was in the beginning of the foundation thereof: and for this purpoſe holy Church we ſee makes it her annuall prayer, ſo muſt we make it our annuall practiſe, to pray in this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the preaching and prayer of our holy mother.</p>

                           <p n="18">18. HEnce hereticks take their riſe to deny merit of good works, but in vain; for the Apoſtle onely means, that humane actions, as humane, are not proportionable to the glory, to that reward we purchaſe by them; and in that ſenſe onely denies our ſufferings to be able to merit heaven. But this notwithſtanding, our humane actions as they are eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the grace of God, in vertue whereof they became <hi>good</hi> and meritorious, and are by that means dipt in the paſſion of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, ſo they are in ſome manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the reward they purchaſe; in as much as they are ſo, the effects of grace and not of nature, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may merit, to be rewarded with eternall bliſſe or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; becauſe grace is, as it were, the ſeed of glory, and ſo what grace produceth, is capable of glory: Thus finite actions become capable of infinite reward; thus one hours martyrdome is capable of eternall glory: the like of other good works.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. This verſe ſhews the greatneſſe of the longing that <hi>creatures</hi> have after heaven; when it ſeems to make the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>expectation</hi> it ſelf, whileſt it ſaith, the <hi>expectation of the creature expecteth,</hi> rather then the creature expecteth. Again, by <hi>creature</hi> in this place is underſtood not onely all mankind, but even all other <hi>creatures</hi> below man; for in man, as in the abſtract of all their perfections, they are, as it were, made happy, when he is rewarded by having God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him face to face, and by his injoying him for all eternity: as who ſhould ſay, All corruptible nature hath then the full of their <hi>expectation,</hi> when corrupted man is inveſted with incorruptible glory: And then they are truly the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> when they are in glory; an honour which the glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels have not, becauſe their nature was never aſſumed by the nature divine, and ſo though they are creatures of glory, in nature more perfect then we, yet are they not children of God ſo properly as men are.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. IT may ſeem a ſtrange piece of divinity in S. Paul (or a miſtake of his ſenſe in me) to diſſuade men from ſin by the Rhetorick or voice of inanimate creatures; as if either they could ſpeak at all, or yet ſpeak more pathetically then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men and bleſſed Angels, for we ſee how often thoſe do ſpeak in vain to ſinners to amend their lives; But who ſo ſhall have read the Expoſitours above upon this preſent Text, will ſee they do incline to this divinity, that our ſinnes are ſo weighty as they make the whole world <hi>groan</hi> beneath the burden of them, ready to ſplit indeed, and unable to keep <hi>the courſe</hi> of Nature, being ſo often interrupted in that <hi>courſe</hi> by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall proceedings; every ſinne being more or leſſe an act againſt the law of Nature it ſelf, as well as againſt the law of God, becauſe all Naturall operations of the creatures are glorious to the Creatour, whereas every ſinne is inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and thence offenſive to the Divine Majeſty.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Hence it is S. Paul begins this Epiſtle firſt, to thoſe whoſe <hi>charity</hi> and love to God gives them a ſenſe of ſin, and to thoſe who are willing to amend their lives by taking pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the preſent puniſhments of ſin; ſuch as are indeed but the naturall effects thereof neither, as ſickneſſe, ſorrow, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, death it ſelf, <hi>Not condigne to the glory that ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in</hi> thoſe who bear with patience the preſent <hi>Paſſions</hi> of <hi>Time;</hi> ſo S. Paul ſtiles thoſe effects of finne, and animates the juſt to bear them patiently in hope of Heaven, a reward ſo great, as will render all thoſe heavy burdens light.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. But the Apoſtle ſpeaks in other language here to ſinners, ſuch as wanting <hi>charity,</hi> have no ſenſe of God, or of future happineſſe; theſe he makes the dumbe world ſpeak unto, in the 20. verſe eſpecially of this epiſtle, <hi>bewailing</hi> the <hi>unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſubjection the whole creature</hi> is in to ſinfull mans <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and looking on her hope to be freed from this generall <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> by the particular ſalvation of ſome few ſaints of men, though not untill their corrupted bodies be made as incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:204830:359"/> by glory at the latter day, as their ſouls are already by that glory bleſſed. Yes beloved, this is the genuine ſenſe of holy Text to day; it tells us all the Fabrick of the world is like to ſplit, it tells us how dumbe creatures cry out ſhame of man to force them ſo againſt their nature to concurre to ſinne, it ſhews the beſtiality of ſinne when beaſts themſelves that never do commit it are aſhamed of beaſtly man, are ſick and weary of him, are tyred in beeing forc'd to ſerve him in his ſinfull wayes, and beg their own ſalvation in the juſt at leaſt, (in which ſenſe holy David ſaid, <hi>Thou O Lord wilt ſave both men and beaſts</hi>) to confound the ſinner, who purſues his own damnation, even to the Torment of the creatures that are not capable of ſinne and yet deteſt it, out of an innate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of honouring Almighty God in all their operations; and ſo deteſt it too, as they are ready to rebell againſt the man of ſinne: in ſo much that holy Church in her charity makes her petition proper to the ſenſe above; as if ſhe were afraid leaſt mans unnaturall wayes of ſinne ſhould force nature out of that order God hath ſet it in, of ſerving man, and pluck a warre of all the other creatures in the world on all man kind, to the diſturbance of the Church in her <hi>devotion</hi> and piety, which at leaſt ſhe begs may be <hi>quiet</hi> and unperturb'd.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THis Verſe ſhewes the power of our Saviours preaching, which drew after him multitudes of people: it ſhewes alſo the ſweetneſſe of his doctrine, and exhorts us Chriſtians to flock in like manner after the preachers of his word, the Prieſts of holy Church, to preſſe upon them, as theſe did upon Chriſt, with zeal, not curioſity. By <hi>the lake of Geneſareth</hi> is underſtood the world; for as that <hi>lake</hi> was ever infeſted with huge winds and tempeſts, ſo is the world continually filled with the noiſes of huge diſtractions, huge troubles, huge temptations, huge dangers of eternal wrack; againſt which it is a good ſafeguard to run after the preachers of holy Church, and by their exhortations to have theſe tempeſts layd.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. By the two Ships may be underſtood the two ſorts of Miſſioners, thoſe who are ſuch by office, and thoſe who of charity are coadjutours to the former. By <hi>the Fiſhers being gone down to waſh their nets,</hi> is intimated unto us that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect to catch ſoules to God, in the muddy and foul nets of humane Invention, but in the <hi>waſhed</hi> and clean <hi>net</hi> of the divine word; as alſo, that thoſe who will hope to gain others to God, muſt have themſelves pure ſoules: this is intimated by the ſtory that tells us here, when Chriſt came with intention to call theſe <hi>Fiſhermen</hi> to be his Apoſtles, he took them in the beſt outward preparation to make them good ſpirituall <hi>Fiſhers,</hi> that is, when their <hi>nets</hi> were <hi>clean.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. His going into <hi>Simons ſhip</hi> argues, that he made S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chayr his Pulpit, out of which himſelf preached, when he converted S. Peter; and by him and his fellow Apoſtles the whole world. By his deſiring Simon to <hi>go off a little from the ſhoar,</hi> (when he that was Lord and maſter of heaven and earth might have commanded it) is inſinuated, that he did not deſire his Vicar S. Peter, nor his Succeſſours ſhould dominear over their flocks; but by ſweet entreaty draw them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:204830:361"/> to what is fit to be done. By <hi>drawing off from the land</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, that a preacher ſhould be in his pulpit, as in another element from the world, that is, not ſo much as near the filth of it, but in the clearer element of a better ſtate of life and manners then the people: and yet the preacher muſt not ſtand at too much diſtance neither from the people, but be near, that they may hear him, and that he may come upon all occaſions to help them. Chriſts <hi>ſitting</hi> and the peoples <hi>ſtanding</hi> to hear him preach argues the authority of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and the reverence the ſchollar ought to bear unto the word of God. Many great Princes have formerly uſed this piety; now every ordinary lay-man looks for a chayr to ſit even when the preacher ſtands.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. As ſoon as he had done preaching he ſets Peter a fiſhing; to ſhew, that after the Word of God is delivered unto us, we ought to labour the putting it in execution according as we are taught. By going <hi>into the deep</hi> to fiſh he intimates, that preachers after their Sermon ought to fall into deep medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and praiſes of Almighty God, and beg that he will inable them to return to the like work again, after that in the deep of contemplation they have prepared themſelves for it: But then the end of this verſe tells the preachers, they muſt <hi>caſt out their nets for fiſh,</hi> that is, they muſt ſo preach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the people of the world, as to gain them, like Fiſhes into the net of Gods ſervice; and it is a huge honour for the people to be thus caught or taken, drawn out of the waters of confuſion and ſin, into the net of order, diſcipline, and grace.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. S. Peters reply argues his huge Faith, which overcame his diffidence after his <hi>whole nights</hi> loſt labour: And this <hi>nightly vain</hi> labour argues the fruitleſſe preaching of thoſe Prieſts, who go to that office out of ſelf conceipt or vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; (as all do that have no true vocation) But then to go when Chriſt, not onely bids us, (as here) but accompanies too, that is to obey as S. Peter did, and to have like hope, as he had, rather in the aſſiſtance of the commander, then in the own abilities of the preacher.</p>
                           <p n="6">
                              <pb n="103" facs="tcp:204830:361"/>6. See the effect of this Faith and obedience, what a <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of Fiſh it brings in: whereof ſome are permanently content to be ſo happily brought in to Gods Church; others (as Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Apoſtates) <hi>break the net,</hi> will keep within no law of God or holy Church, but give law to themſelves, or rather take liberty to live without all law: So by <hi>this net</hi> we ſee is underſtood the bounds of the Catholike Church.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. By their <hi>beckning to their fellowes in the other ſhip</hi> is ſignified their exclamation, and noiſe of admiration (to ſee ſo huge and unexpected a draught) was ſo great that they could not hope to be heard, but by ſignes made means to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to deſire help. And by this their deſire of help we, that ſucceed them, are taught never to preſume, that we alone are able to comply with the great calling of Apoſtolical Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but ſhall do well to require help of any devout neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours or fellow Miſſioners. By theſe that came <hi>to help them</hi> we may piouſly underſtand, that not onely <hi>our fellow Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Clergy,</hi> but alſo the religious orders of Gods Church were prefigured, who are indeed excellent fellow-Miſſioners, or Fiſhers to help to catch ſoules to God, and come when they are called as coadjutours to thoſe who by office have care of ſoules, which were both hinted in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe of this chapter: ſee the gloſſe thereon, as above. O that we could once ſee this happy, this brotherly concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Gods ſervice! then would the ſhip of Chriſt his holy Church <hi>almoſt ſink,</hi> that is, be full fraighted, as ſhe could poſſibly ſail, and then we might hope ſhe would enter ſafe into the harbour of eternal reſt, when the labours of her mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſtate would be converted into the repoſe of her ſtate Triumphant.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. 9. 10. Onely Peter of all the reſt (aſtoniſhed as they were at the miracle) expreſſed himſelf more then others did thereat; fell immediately at our Saviours feet to adore that power which had wrought this miracle: and for this his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Faith and humiliation, ſee him exalted and made head of all the Church; to ſhew, we cannot out do Almighty God
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:204830:362"/> in goodneſſe; his rewards are never ſhort, but alwayes above our works. And 'tis worth obſerving, that S. Peter here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires Jeſus <hi>to go from him,</hi> becauſe he is a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and doeth not deſerve the honour of his preſence: A high expreſſion of humility in him, and of his reverence to the perſon of his Lord; as if he had rather loſe the honour of Chriſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, then ſo great a Majeſty ſhould be diſhonoured by ſo unworthy company, as his, and all the reſt that were, as the ninth verſe ſayes, all aſtoniſhed at the greatneſſe of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, in ſuch an unexpected draught of Fiſh; whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour comforts up in the tenth verſe, and bids Peter caſt off <hi>his fear,</hi> becauſe he ſhould be from that time a <hi>fiſher of men,</hi> of ſoules, which he ſhould bring in as great ſhoales to heaven, as theſe fiſhes came to his net.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. What marvel they <hi>left all</hi> to follow ſo good, ſo great a Maſter, who did not alter but exalt their trade, by inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling their draught, which was formerly food onely for mens tables, but henceforward they ſhould take <hi>Fiſh</hi> that ſhould be ſerved up to the table of the King of heaven, of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THe ſum of this Goſpel is the demonſtration of our Saviours <hi>charity</hi> to his Apoſtles, and of his like love to all the world by their Miniſtry, whom he profeſſeth here to make <hi>Fiſhers of men,</hi> converters of ſoules, by their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preaching, according as himſelf inſtructed them in that art by his own Sermon to them, and to the multitude that followed him.

                           <p n="8">8. St. Peter here recapitulates ſome of the chief vertues, which make a perfect Chriſtian. No marvel he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with <hi>unanimity,</hi> be it in prayer, or otherwiſe in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Actions, becauſe this vertue is radicated in the B. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the ground of all Chriſtianity; for there the three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Perſons are not onely <hi>all of one mind,</hi> but of one eſſence too: in imitation whereof Chriſtians are taught to be all <hi>of one mind,</hi> all ayming ſtill in every action at the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and glory of one onely God, as the Angels do. The Apoſtle puts <hi>compaſſion</hi> next, to ſhew that each Chriſtian
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:204830:364"/> ſhould be as ſenſible of his neighbours ſufferings, as his own ſoul is ſenſible of the pain in any member of his own body. This vertue flowes indeed from the former <hi>unanimity,</hi> for where there is but <hi>one mind</hi> or ſoul, as it were, there muſt be one and the ſame ſenſe or <hi>compaſſion.</hi> And this vertue of <hi>compaſſion</hi> extends as well towards our being ſenſible of each good in our neighbour, (and zealous to imitate it) as of any evil we ſee in him, out of a zeal to remedy or cure the ſame. So excellent is the unity of Chriſtianity. Hence alſo flowes the next vertue, <hi>lovers of the fraternity;</hi> to ſhew that the grace of our Religion teacheth us to imitate the perfection of nature; ſo to love one another, being Brothers in grace, as we do that are Brothers in nature. When we are bid <hi>Be merciful,</hi> it is as if we were told our <hi>compaſſion</hi> muſt be even from the Bowels of our hearts. <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> are well joyntly recommended together, becauſe they are indeed inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable companions, as it were; and ſo in this exteriour ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <hi>modeſty,</hi> (rendring the whole perſon exteriourly gratefull) and in her inſeparable companion <hi>humility,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> cloſeth up his enumeration of vertues; ending with <hi>humility,</hi> becauſe that is indeed both the baſis and ſummity of all others; for as it muſt be the firſt, (as captivating mans proud reaſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Faith) ſo if it go not hand in hand up to the top of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with other vertues, even with <hi>charity</hi> the Queen of them all, that great Queen cannot ſtand faſt in her throne, but upon the feet of <hi>humility.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="9">9. S. Peter here forbids not the flowing of Juſtice, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of juſt revenge, when it is legal; but onely private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation of <hi>evil for evil;</hi> and exhorts that each private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>bleſſe</hi> and not <hi>curſe</hi> thoſe which do him miſchief: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as the end of all our temporal evils is eternal <hi>Bliſſe;</hi> ſo we muſt (in hope of that for our ſelves) <hi>Bleſſe</hi> thoſe that do us evil. O rare perfection of Chriſtianity!</p>
                           <p n="10">10. By theſe three next verſes taken out of Davids mouth, S. Peter proveth, that to repay <hi>evil for evil</hi> is our natures propenſion, but bids us forbear, as we will hope to have our own <hi>evil</hi> deeds towards God forgiven, and the little good we
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:204830:365"/> do rewarded with <hi>eternal life:</hi> called here <hi>ſeeing good dayes;</hi> for thoſe are chiefly <hi>good</hi> which ſhine with glory over our heads; though the <hi>dayes</hi> of grace here are not deprived of that Epitheton too. We are therefore bid <hi>refrain our tongues,</hi> becauſe when they be looſe and unbridled, that alone begets <hi>bad dayes</hi> unto us; every one judging him to have a bad heart, that hath a bad or an unbridled tongue: and how can the lips of an ill tongue ſpeak other then guilt, when they betray the guiltineſſe of their own heart?</p>
                           <p n="11">11. <hi>The declining evil and doing good</hi> is an abſtract of all Chriſtian duty, and a perfect rule of Chriſtian perfection. 'Tis reaſon to bid us <hi>ſeek peace</hi> and <hi>follow it,</hi> as being the ſpecial gift of our Saviour, which he brought with him from heaven at his birth; and then the Angels beſtowed it amongſt us; the holy Ghoſt did the like at his coming too, and Chriſt at his going, left it as his Farewel, as hath been ſaid before, yet is not here unſeaſonably repeated.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. By <hi>the eye of our Lord</hi> underſtand the piercing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Almighty God, whereby he ſees into the ſecrets of all hearts, and ſeeing them lovers of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> heares all the <hi>prayers</hi> they make unto him, and grants them all they ask: By his <hi>Countenance,</hi> underſtand here that diſpleaſure he ſhews at the latter day unto the wicked, when he pronounceth the ſentence of damnation againſt them; for how ever he doth not damne every man in his actual ſin, but differrs his juſtice till the latter day, yet he looks on their iniquity that do ſin, with the ſame diſpleaſing <hi>countenance,</hi> as at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when it will be a greater torment to behold the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that <hi>countenance,</hi> then to ſuffer hell fire. O that we could in all Temptations to ſin reflect on this Truth, ſo ſhould we avoid the fact, that will merit this effect!</p>
                           <p n="13">13. A happy ſhield againſt evil to <hi>emulate</hi> vertue and <hi>goodneſſe. Emulation</hi> here imports a vehement zeal and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſoul towards vertue; not a faint velleity or wiſh of it, but a ſtrong will and action too; and ſo makes a ſtrong ſhield not onely againſt all vice, but even againſt all miſchief: for S. Auſtin ſayes well, no body is hurt, but by himſelf; by
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:204830:365"/> his own ſin; therefore if all men be <hi>emulatours</hi> of vertue, they are ſheltred from <hi>all evil</hi> or hurt from others: <q>And this one of the Churches prayers in Lent aſſures us of, <hi>that no adverſity ſhall hurt us, if no iniquity dominear over us.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p n="14">14. Doubtleſſe thoſe are <hi>Bleſſed</hi> that <hi>ſuffer for juſtice,</hi> ſince Jeſus Chriſt who is verity it ſelf, hath numbered thoſe among the <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> nay among thoſe who actually are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of heaven; as if a patient ſuffering an unjuſt perſecution here, were a heaven to the ſufferer, even whileſt he is in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and as if God were not content to reward that kind of <hi>ſuffering</hi> with future <hi>Bliſſe,</hi> but with a preſent <hi>Beatitude.</hi> After which followes well the end of the verſe, that we ſhould nor <hi>fear,</hi> nor <hi>be troubled</hi> at our unjuſt perſecutours; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by our patience we are, as it were, out of their power, which aymes onely at our affliction and vexation; and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof, leaves us free from <hi>fear</hi> of any miſchief they can do us. S. Laurence on the Gridiron was a good proof of this.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. It followes, we do then <hi>ſanctifie Chriſt in our hearts,</hi> when they are wholly ſet upon him, and regard not any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief hell it ſelf can do us, when our hearts are inflamed with the love of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THe Illuſtration upon this Prayer tells us at how great a height of perfection S. Peter aymes in the Text of this Epiſtle, when no leſſe then an abſolute ſayntity, is the rule he gives for Chriſtianity. And this is evident, whileſt we ſee the Apoſtle exhort not onely to all manner of poſitive, but even to negative ſayntity withall; not onely to have us <hi>do</hi> all ſort of <hi>good,</hi> but to have us <hi>decline</hi> all kind of <hi>evill</hi> whatſoever; not onely alwayes to do well, but alſo never to do ill; not onely finally to be Saints, but never to be ſinners, after we have once the happineſſe to be Chriſtians.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. And to this purpoſe he lights up all the lamps of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:204830:366"/> which you ſee him recommend to day unto us: adviſing that our <hi>charity</hi> march alwayes through the wilderneſſe of this wicked world as men do reſt by night in deſerts, when to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves from the ravenous beaſts that hunt their prey by night, they make a ring of fire round about them, and ſo ſleep ſecurely: now in regard we have a <hi>Noon-day devil</hi> hunts our ſouls by day, as well as night, therefore S. Peter circles us about not onely in the never dying fire of brighteſt <hi>charity,</hi> (which the devil hates and flies) but with the lamps and torches of a many other virtues burning bright about us, ſo to prevent us from the Fiends <hi>mid-day incurſions,</hi> as well as from his ſeizures in the night, becauſe the leaſt light of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the leaſt glimmering of ſaintity dazels the eyes of this foul fiends iniquity, and makes him run away.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Now in regard all men are apt to dwell upon their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent objects with delight, and to delude themſelves that every ſinne they do commit, hath an apparent goodneſſe in it at the leaſt, of pleaſure, or of profit; therefore to day, leſt we ſhould be deceived with ſemblances of that which is not true, leſt we ſhould run after the folly-fires of the devil as after vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or follow his flying light of ſeeming ſaintity, and ſo loſe the ſociety of reall virtues in the deſert of this world; holy Church makes her prayer particular againſt allurements of all appearing good, whileſt ſhe draws our thoughts and eyes to things <hi>inviſible;</hi> as if nothing we ſee were worthy our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, nothing that we have worth our poſſeſſing; and ſo perſwades us altogether to covet what we have not yet, to wiſh for what we ſee not, to hope for what is <hi>promiſed,</hi> as being far above what ever is, or can be here poſſeſt.</p>
                           <q>And that we may do this ſhe begs in the prayer above (as a ſpeciall gift) of God, to give us <hi>a deſire of loving</hi> him unſeen, and the <hi>Inviſibles</hi> that he hath <hi>promiſed</hi> us, ſurpaſſing all our own <hi>deſires,</hi> as farre as they do our poſſeſſions.</q>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:204830:367"/> image was vilified by us. So that in the balance of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an perfection, any the leaſt ſinne of <hi>anger</hi> is veniall; the expreſſion of it in ill terms (as <hi>Raca</hi>) is doubtfull, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of <hi>Councill,</hi> whether veniall or mortall; any notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion (as <hi>fool</hi>) is doubtleſſe mortall, and ſo damnable, if it be ſo expreſſed as that thereby we really deſire to exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and provoke our neighbour to indignation againſt us: for if in jeſt 'tis otherwiſe; if it be to ſuch perſons as we may jeſt withall; but if to our betters, there ſuch jeſts are odious, and not to be uſed by any means.</p>
                           <p n="24">24, 25. Theſe verſes cloſe up the difference of perfection between the <hi>Phariſaicall</hi> and Chriſtian Laws: the former taught that by ſacrifice, and oblations at the <hi>Altar</hi> into the hands of the Prieſt, all their ſinnes were expiated, whether they made ſatisfaction to the parties offended, and injured by them, or not. This our Saviour beats down, and forbids us to hope for pardon from him, by any our ſacrifices or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochings to the <hi>Altar,</hi> and to Prieſts, unleſſe we make our ſelves worthy to partake of our own offerings to God, by a previous juſtice done unto the world; unleſſe, having abuſed thy brother by <hi>Raca,</hi> or <hi>fool,</hi> (as above) thou firſt ask him pardon; much more muſt we do juſtice, if the injuſtice hath been yet greater. The reaſon of this is, that juſtice is alwayes of neceſſity, ſacrifice many times of devotion onely: Where note, this doctrine of our Saviour is not onely (as ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) a <hi>counſell,</hi> but indeed a <hi>precept,</hi> becauſe <hi>reconciliation</hi> is neceſſary by way of <hi>precept,</hi> ſacrifice not alwayes ſo; and becauſe God is never <hi>reconciled</hi> to us, whileſt our neighbour is juſtly offended at us. Note, this precept obligeth onely, when with diſcretion it can be fulfilled, when without ſcandall, (amongſt other obſtacles;) ſo that you may receive, though you have given a private offence to one abſent, without going from the <hi>Altar</hi> to ask pardon, provided you reſolve to do it, when you meet the offended, and be actually then ſorry for it; yes, you may in ſuch caſe receive, and are not bound to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your guilt to others: but without this internall ſorrow, and purpoſe of a reall externall ſatisfaction, (in time and

                           <p n="1">1. BY the drift of this Goſpel it will appear I made no ſtreined application of the prayer above unto the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſenſe of the Epiſtle; for what elſe is the whole ſcope of this Goſpel (which muſt ever be the ſame with the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) but a putting out of the <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> of the feigned ſaintity of Judaiſme by the true fire of Chriſtian <hi>charity?</hi> much as the ſun-beams falling on the dimmer light of bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fire, ſeem to extinguiſh it, and make the flames thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> forbidding <hi>murder</hi> under the ſervile fear of humane judgement unto death, was (in regard of true Religion) like the dimme light of fire placed in the beams of the Meridian ſun: The Sonne of juſtice Jeſus Chriſt forbidding <hi>murder,</hi> not ſo much for fear of death, as, for fear of putting out the fire of <hi>charity</hi> to God, and to our neighbour, and of taking in our hands the Glow-worm of <hi>wrath and anger,</hi> a paſſion that ſeems to have a flame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but 'tis a flame of hypocriſie, of <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> of folly-fire onely, not of reall virtue.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To conclude, ſee how the Goſpel ſtrikes it yet more home, when even the ſeeming flame of ſacrifice and <hi>offering at the Altar</hi> is a cheat to charity, is a <hi>Phariſaicall</hi> but not a Chriſtian duty of Religion, unleſſe we light the lamp of <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love</hi> withall; unleſſe we be at peace with one another, we cannot hope to have a peace with God. O beloved, who ſo ſhort-ſighted now as not to ſee appearing ſaintity is nothing worth unleſſe it be as reall as it ſeems to be? Philoſophy teacheth us this leſſon of Chriſtianity; <hi>A thing is good when it is made ſo by the integrity of its cauſe,</hi> good every way: ſo is it with a Chriſtian, he is good to God, when he is made ſo, by beeing alſo good unto his neighbour; but he cannot be ſo,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:204830:368"/> while he offers ſacrifice to God with his hand, and to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with his heart, at the ſame time: ſuch is our receiving the bleſſed Sacrament before we are perfectly reconciled to all the world; it is not the viſible good action of receiving that makes a good Chriſtian, unleſſe his <hi>inviſible</hi> good intention make him ſo, that is, unleſſe he privately forgive all the world; and reſolve at leaſt, publickly to do it when firſt he meets with any man that he hath odds withall. So ſtill we ſee the reality of our goodneſſe conſiſts more in the <hi>inviſibility,</hi> then in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apparence of it, and for this cauſe</p>
                           <q>Holy Church, in her prayer upon this dayes Goſpel, begs an affection to <hi>the Inviſible</hi> God, to the yet <hi>unſeen good things</hi> which he hath <hi>promiſed,</hi> as if all we ſee were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth in compariſon of things <hi>inviſible</hi> which we are <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi>

TO be <hi>baptized in Chriſt,</hi> is to be chriſtned according as Chriſt hath commanded, in the name of <hi>the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt;</hi> to be <hi>baptized in his death,</hi> is as much as to ſay, in repreſentation of his <hi>death,</hi> and that our Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme hath force and vertue from the merits of <hi>his death and paſſion;</hi> and ſignifies, that as Chriſt <hi>died</hi> on the Croſſe to this naturall life, ſo the <hi>baptized</hi> die to ſinne, and live to Chriſt, which is a life oppoſite to that of a ſinner.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. This verſe adds more to the Analogie, ſaying, we are not onely <hi>dead</hi> to ſinne in Baptiſme, but thereby alſo <hi>buried</hi> with him, in proof of our death to ſinne. So that the Trine Immerſion uſed in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> alludes to the three dayes that Chriſt lay <hi>buried</hi> in his grave, as our ſinnes in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> lie drowned under the water thereof: And for this cauſe holy Church makes a ſolemn <hi>Baptiſme</hi> yearly on Eaſter eve; to ſhew, that thereby thoſe who <hi>died</hi> &amp; were <hi>buried</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> do alſo riſe with him, <hi>by the glory of his heavenly Father,</hi> (that is, to glorifie him) to a <hi>new life in him:</hi> in teſtimony, whereof the baptized have a white garment caſt over them, called the Chriſome, to ſhew the purity of their ſouls; and are adviſed to carry the ſame inward purity with them to the tribunall of Chriſt, as a proofe of their fidelity to their vow in holy Baptiſme of renouncing the world, the fleſh, and the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204830:370"/> devill, ſo to conſerve their puritie or <hi>newneſſe</hi> of life; to the which the Fathers exhort earneſtly, when they inculcate the frequent memory of our baptiſmall vow; which they ground in theſe words, <hi>ſo we alſo may walk,</hi> importing, ſo we may perſevere in that purity.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. See how this verſe inſiſts further upon the conſequence of our ſpirituall <hi>reſurrection</hi> even in this life, by our ſpirituall death and buriall as above; ſhewing that our <hi>newneſſe of life</hi> by Baptiſm, is like the <hi>ingrafting us</hi> into the ſtock or tree of Chriſt, whence we are to receive all our future ſap or nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo that as his death (to naturall life) was the way to his reſurrection; in like manner our <hi>death (to ſinne)</hi> is the way to our <hi>reſurrection</hi> with him: and as we ſee <hi>graft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>

                              </hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the changes of the tree they are ingrafted in, ſeem in the winter to die with it, in the ſpring to revive with it; ſo do we by Baptiſme in Chriſt ſeem to die with him in the winter of his paſſion, but revive in the ſpring of his reſurrection.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Then we know indeed <hi>our old man to be crucified with Chriſt;</hi> when the new man lives in him. By the <hi>old Man</hi> underſtand cuſtome of ſinning renounced by Baptiſme; by <hi>the body of ſinne</hi> underſtand here the whole maſſe of our ſinnes; <hi>by the destruction</hi> of it underſtand, not the palliation of it onely, by imputative Juſtice, as heretikes do, but the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute death thereof by inherent juſtice, infuſed by baptiſmall grace into our ſouls.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. And this ſenſe is confirmed by the next verſe, ſaying, <hi>he that is dead</hi> (meaning to ſinne) is <hi>justified from ſinne;</hi> lives by the infuſed Juſtice, which hath killed, and not onely covered ſinnes in the baptized.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. This verſe imports our future life eternall, which we firmly <hi>believe</hi> we ſhall injoy with Chriſt, if here we die with him to ſinne.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. The ſenſe of the precedent verſe is confirmed by this following, that tells us, <hi>death</hi> ſhall as little reign over us in the next life, (if we truely die to ſinne in this) as it did <hi>over Chriſt once riſen from his grave:</hi> and yet withall alludes to the conſtancie we ought to have in good works, even in this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:204830:371"/> life; that having once had the happineſſe to live ſpiritually here, we ſhould diſdain to die again by relapſe into ſinne, and ſo to let <hi>death dominear ever us,</hi> whom once we had ſlain by grace. Note here the ſtrange goodneſſe of our Saviour, who being God, was content to let <hi>death once dominear</hi> over him on the Croſſe, that we might for ever after triumph with him over <hi>death.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="10">10. Here Chriſt is not to be underſtood to <hi>die to ſinne,</hi> as we doe, but <hi>to die for ſinne,</hi> not his own, but ours; and that <hi>once, for all our ſinnes.</hi> Where he is ſaid here <hi>to live to God,</hi> underſtand <hi>with God,</hi> a bleſſed and immortall life; as alſo, that by ſo living he may perpetually praiſe and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Almightie God; ſince as he died <hi>for ſinnes abolition,</hi> ſo he lives for Gods glorification.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. 'Tis reaſon we ſhould <hi>think our ſelves dead to ſinne,</hi> when by <hi>Baptiſme</hi> we renounce it; and <hi>living to God,</hi> when by the ſame <hi>Baptiſme</hi> we live in him. But it is a high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the alteration which the Apoſtle exhorts unto, in adviſing us <hi>to think we are dead to ſinne:</hi> for as dead men have no motion at all; ſo we ought not to move the leaſt ſtep <hi>towards ſinne,</hi> when once we are by <hi>Baptiſme</hi> dead unto it: and therefore it followes well, that all our vitall motion ſhould be towards God, towards his honour and glory in Chriſt Jeſus; leſt we fall back from the <hi>life</hi> of grace, to the <hi>death</hi> of ſinne; which we can never do, if in imitation of Chriſts life we ſquare ours. For that is underſtood <hi>by living to God in Chriſt,</hi> glorifying God, by following the footſteps of his Sonne our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; who ſo lived after his <hi>reſurrection</hi> that he never died more, and deſires we may ſo <hi>live</hi> in grace, as never to <hi>die</hi> in ſinne again, <hi>being once freed from it</hi> by holy <hi>Baptiſme.</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. IT ſtands with all the reaſon in the world, that where <hi>the increaſe of Religion, and Practiſe of Piety</hi> are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned, there ſhould be laid the ground-work of Religion to

IN <hi>thoſe dayes,</hi> ſignifies here about that time, and doth not determine exactly any day; For what was now done, was not the work of one onely day, but of divers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many people had flocked together to behold our Saviour and his prodigious works; as alſo to hear him ſpeak, and preach unto them; ſo attractive was all he ſaid or did: as we ſee here, they were even careleſſe how to ſubſiſt; when our Saviour himſelf was the firſt that proved ſolicitous about them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And by <hi>calling his diſciples,</hi> he ſhewes us example to conſult with our Brethren, and not to rely onely upon our ſelves in difficulties.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In this ſecond verſe he tells his Diſciples, <hi>he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of the multitude, that had row indured with him three dayes,</hi> and <hi>had not what to eat.</hi> Bleſſed God! how tender is thy heart to thoſe that ſuffer purely for thy ſake! as theſe did; if yet their ſuffering were not rather a content to them, then otherwiſe: <q>For 'tis not, ſaith S.

                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. As in the third verſe is ſaid, if they <hi>had been diſmiſſed faſting they might have fainted,</hi> having <hi>ſome of them far to go home.</hi> See here the reward of perſeverance in good works: how our Saviour requites but three dayes <hi>ſuſteining,</hi> with a miraculous banquet. And indeed his aym was more at feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſoules by the miracle, then their bodies by meat; however his diſciples underſtood him to mean onely a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral repaſt unto the people, when they replyed, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</p>
                           <p n="4">4. In order to the corporal food, that it was not to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for in the deſert or <hi>wilderneſſe.</hi> This incredulity our Saviour permitted in his diſciples, both for their own and the peoples greater ſatisfaction afterwards, when beyond all humane hope he had provided a feaſt <hi>in the deſert</hi> for his ſervants, as God had done for the Jewes, when even Moyſes their leader deſpaired of it, as the diſciples now did.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. The Interrogatory in this verſe argues not any his ignorance of the number of <hi>loaves</hi> that were amongſt them; but he asks the queſtion, that by the anſwer thereunto, thoſe who before knew not the number of them, ſhould (by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſlender it was) admire the miracle the more that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; when out of the myſtical number of <hi>ſeven loaves,</hi> four thouſand perſons were fed: For myſtical they were, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving relation to the <hi>ſeven Sacraments,</hi> which are ſo many ſeveral conduit-pipes of Gods grace into our ſoules, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are ſpiritually fed, as thoſe four thouſand men were temporally with <hi>ſeven loaves:</hi> they Were figures alſo of the ſeven-fold grace of the Holy Ghoſt, giving to us ſeven ſpecial vertues; three Theological, four Cardinal in holy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: as alſo of the ſeven gifts beſide of the ſame holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. That <hi>the ground</hi> was the Table whereon our Saviour made his feaſt is no marvell; for ſo in the law of nature men ſate at meals, to ſhew the ſuperfluity of coſtly tables was as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle agreeable to God, as the exceſſe of their diſhes alſo were:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:204830:373"/> and therefore here is onely <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>fiſh</hi> to feaſt upon; ſince nature being content with little, grace will not make her any meanes of exceſſe. That he <hi>brake,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> the <hi>bread</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it <hi>multiplyed,</hi> argues the vertue of his <hi>Benediction</hi> to have cauſed the <hi>multiplication:</hi> ſo in the beginning of the world, he <hi>bleſſed</hi> the creatures, which he bid <hi>encreaſe and multiply,</hi> to ſhew their <hi>multiplication</hi> was the fruit or effect of <hi>his Benediction.</hi> That he gave not <hi>the bread</hi> himſelf to the people, but to <hi>his diſciples</hi> to diſtribute, argues <hi>his breaking</hi> to the world the <hi>bread</hi> of his holy word, not immediately by himſelf, but by his Apoſtles and their Succeſſours.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. The addition <hi>of fiſhes</hi> to the <hi>bread</hi> of this banquet, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that Prieſts muſt alwayes adde unto the word of God, the pulpe or pap of good life; that ſo our food may be in all kinds nouriſhing to ſoules.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. That hungry people did <hi>eat their fill</hi> no marvel, when God allowed plenty. That they took up the ſcraps, was to inſtruct us never to permit the leaſt of Gods Bleſſings to be waſted or loſt, (much leſſe the leaſt of Gods words, here ſignified by the crums falling from the Preachers mouth.) That <hi>there were ſeven basquets full of fragments</hi> no marvel neither, ſince there were <hi>ſeven loaves</hi> at firſt; and ſo it was fitting the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of <hi>multiplication</hi> ſhould appear in each, by the reliques of every one of them; as alſo to ſhew, that all Almes to the poor are rewarded with abundance remaining to the giver,</p>
                           <p n="9">9. This verſe onely recounts the number of thoſe who were preſent at the feaſt, and ſhared in the miracle; who were not <hi>diſmiſſed,</hi> till each of them were ſatisfied and had their fill, to ſhew that God leaves none of his ſervants unrewarded, for their paines of loving and following him whereſoever he goes.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. IT is admirable to ſee the fecundity of Gods holy Spirit: how aptly the Prayer above correſponds to theſe two
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:204830:374"/> Texts that ſeem far differing from one another, yet are both driving at all the ſame ends of <hi>increaſing Religion</hi> in us, and <hi>of nouriſhing the good things</hi> it beſtowes upon us <hi>by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Piety.</hi> Which <hi>Piety</hi> we ſee was a ſpecial gift of the Holy Ghoſt, infuſed into us in holy Baptiſme, and for the which we can no wayes be anſwerable to Almighty God, but by the continual <hi>ſtudy or practiſe of it:</hi> and doubtleſſe this <hi>Piety</hi> is then very well practiſed in one particular thereof, when men frequent the Bleſſed Sacrament, which is the trueſt <hi>nouriſhment of goodneſſe</hi> in us that can be imagined.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Nor is this other then a genuine ſenſe of the preſent Texts, both of the Goſpel and of the Prayer to day: For all Expoſitours agree, that this miracle alludes to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament, whereby not onely many thouſands but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite millions of ſoules are fed, and thereby <hi>nouriſhed</hi> in the perfection of that <hi>Religion,</hi> which by holy Baptiſme (as above) they made profeſſion of. So that here by the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Piety</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>the frequent Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. True it is, we were told upon Sunday within the Octaves of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> that this Communion was then given us (as the figure thereof was given under the Juniper Tree to Elias) for a food ſufficient to carry us through the <hi>long way we had then to go,</hi> before we came to Advent, but that notwithſtanding, we may receive it as frequently as holy <hi>Piety</hi> moves us thereunto: For this advantage the ſubſtance hath above the ſhadow, the thing figured above the figure of it; that what was once done to ſuffice for the nature of a figure, may be often exerciſed in the thing figured, becauſe the love of grace is perfected by the frequent exerciſes of thoſe acts that do confer grace; whence it is, that holy Church obligeth us once a year at leaſt (and that about Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) to receive this Sacrament as a <hi>viaticum</hi> unto us, for the journey we are to make in the long way of vertue all the year after. Nevertheleſſe, by way of <hi>practiſing Piety,</hi> our pious Mother allowes the frequent Communion beſides, permits us to eat of this heavenly food, (this bread of Angels) as often
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:204830:374"/> as our devotion moves us thereunto, by permiſſion of our Ghoſtly Fathers; (not otherwiſe) which to thoſe that have many worldly buſineſſes may be every moneth or three weeks, it being now thereabouts ſince the Octaves ended of the Bleſſed Sacrament, that now we have a memory of that holy myſtery again, and may be a good ground for Prieſts to regulate this devotion by: yet this may be more or leſſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, as the diſcretion of the ghoſtly Fathers ſhall order; according to the progreſſe their penitents make in vertue by this, and other <hi>Practiſes of Piety:</hi> For to permit more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent communion to thoſe that do not daily advance in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, were rather to give way to a dangerous ſingularity, then to the <hi>practiſe</hi> of a profitable <hi>Piety;</hi> ſince more regard muſt be had to a worthy receiving, then to the frequency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                           <q>Say now the Prayer above, and ſee if both it, and the Goſpel be not exactly exhauſted by this ſpecial <hi>Practiſe of Piety,</hi> called <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Communion.</hi>

                           <p>This prayer doubtleſſe is very well ſuited to the preſent cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous times we live in, when we have no other helm to ſteer us out of the ſea of troubles we are in, but that <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> we now call upon; which is <hi>ſo dispoſed,</hi> as (however we ſeem toſſed in the waves of deſtruction) it will infallibly bring us to the ſafe port of ſalvation, if we ſail or hold our courſe according to that <hi>Providence:</hi> ſince it is moſt certain, that God Almighty never intends our ruine by the miſeries he permits to fall upon us, but rather our ſalvation, if we bear them with conformity to his holy will. But we muſt find the prayer adapted to this preſent Epiſtle and Goſpel too, elſe we fail of our deſign. You will have anon the literall ſenſe of both expounded; but we muſt now proſecute our further aim of making it appear, this prayer is, as it were, an abſtract of them both. In which holy Church would teach us how to caſt our ſelves upon the <hi>providence</hi> of God with a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to his divine will: as who ſhould ſay, O God, we know thou haſt environed mankind with a world of internall and externall evils, yet thou that art omnipotent canſt remove thoſe evils, or <hi>things which are hurtfull,</hi> out of our way, and canſt afford us <hi>all that is good and beneficiall to us,</hi>
                              <pb n="131" facs="tcp:204830:375"/> ſince we doubt not but thy goodneſſe hath a deſire to ſave each of us; and conſequently haſt ſo diſpoſed of us in thy ſaving <hi>Providence,</hi> as (notwithſtanding all the evils that environ us) thy will of ſaving us ſhall not be <hi>fruſtrated.</hi> No, not maugre all the internall evils mentioned in the Epiſtle, of our own <hi>fleſh and bloud</hi> propending us to perpetuall ſinne; nor all the externall evils mentioned in the Goſpel, of <hi>ravenous wolves, of falſe prophets,</hi> who under colour of ſaving our ſouls ſeek to ſwallow them up into the mouth of hell. For as againſt our internall evils, we find helps in the Epiſtle, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick, eaſie helps, ſuch as S. Paul is almoſt aſhamed to name, our own fleſh and bloud captivated onely to the rule of reaſon and grace: in like manner we find helps in the Goſpel againſt our externall evils, <hi>falſe prophets or teachers,</hi> when we are in the Goſpel taught how to diſtinguiſh them from true and ſafe guides, by looking into their lives and works, which are compared there to <hi>fruits of trees;</hi> that is, if their lives be good, we may ſafely follow them; if bad, we muſt avoid them. And certainly, as we have no internall enemy greater then <hi>our own fleſh and bloud</hi> ill regulated, ſo we have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall greater then <hi>falſe prophets,</hi> ill teachers, ſince the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens lives ought to be ſquared unto the lives of their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all leaders; and when any of theſe are falſe guides, it is like the corruption of the beſt thing, which alwayes is the worſt corruption. O how fitly then doth holy Church to day (reflecting on theſe internall and externall enemies or evils) mind Almighty God in this prayer of that his <hi>never-failing providence,</hi> when to ſecure us that it be not <hi>fruſtrated in us,</hi> ſhe bids us deprecate all thoſe <hi>evils</hi> that may indanger it, and beg all thoſe <hi>helps</hi> that may conduce unto it! Say then, beloved, this prayer with this relation to the Epiſtle and Goſpel, both which it ſweetly ſummes up unto you; and ſay it with ſuch a fervour of ſpirit, as it ſelf imports; that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching God to looke upon us as loſt ſouls amidſt ſo many dangers as he hath placed us in, unleſſe he uſe his own omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent power, to make good in us his ſaving <hi>Providence:</hi> For then God hears beſt, when we pray with moſt earneſtneſſe; and

                           <p n="20">20. That is to ſay, by making <hi>ſinne</hi> your maſter, you had caſt off all the yoke of duty you ow to <hi>juſtice</hi> (the miſtreſſe under whom you ought to ſerve God.) So <hi>free to juſtice,</hi>

                           <p n="3">3. Now in regard Almighty God hath made no fleſh at all of his ſpirituall counſels, and in regard we ſee his wiſdome hath

And it is onely Gods infinite mercy, that whileſt we <hi>yield bad fruit,</hi> (whileſt we ſinne mortally) we are not preſently damned; for ſo we deſerve to be. And in the ſame third chapter <hi>the hatchet</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>placed at the root of the tree,</hi> to cut it inſtantly down; meaning, Chriſt is come, whoſe Law is ready to paſſe upon us, whoſe ſentence is ready to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon every mortall ſinne, (for then we are ſpiritually dead) and after death judgement is inſtantly ready; nay our own guilty conſciences do even immediately pronounce our ſentence of damnation, unleſſe God give us grace to repent and amend, by <hi>producing good fruits</hi> again.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. AS in the Epiſtle above Saint Paul bid the Laymen <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi> of their greateſt internall enemies or evils, (their own fleſh) ſo in this Goſpell Saint Matthew bids the ſame Lay-people <hi>take great heed</hi> of their moſt dangerous externall

We are therefore (as in the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration was obſerved) by this dayes doctrine, armed againſt all enemies whatſoever, internall or externall, by the prudence of holy Church, collecting at once all the motives that may be to increaſe our love and <hi>charity</hi> to Almighty God, in ſhewing us how his infinite <hi>Providence</hi> hath ſecured our way to Heaven, by pointing out every danger that we can encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the way.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. And as the Lay-man hath no better guides to heaven, then thoſe that preach and teach the Word of God unto him, that catechiſe and inſtruct him in the Principles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine, that offer ſacrifice to God for him, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments of God unto him; (becauſe with theſe guides it is he truſts his very ſoul) ſo in regard there are that doe uſurp this office of Prophets, of Teachers and Preachers to the very bane, poyſon, perdition and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſouls, it was hugely neceſſary the divine <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> ſhould arme us againſt this worſt of evils, by giving us a rule to know theſe impudent uſurpers by, theſe falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets from the true ones: which knowledge we ſhall have by looking on the <hi>fruits</hi> of one and the other: them that bring <hi>good fruit</hi> we are to follow, them that <hi>bring forth bad</hi> to flie.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Now becauſe holy Church hath not made the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man abſolutely Judge in this particular, therefore while her Doctours (preaching on this Text) give all the ſignes of true and falſe Prophets, ſhe contents her ſelfe the Lay-men have recourſe to God Almighties <hi>Providence</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and that they onely follow thoſe who make their works anſwerable to their Doctrine, who doe as well as teach <hi>the will of God:</hi> For as they onely are true lovers of him who keep his Commandements, ſo ſuch onely are to be the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens guides.

Again, if we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſiſt by the preſervation of Almighty God, (as is moſt true) how can we preſume <hi>to live</hi> unto <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and not <hi>unto him?</hi> As therefore our beeing is purely and onely <hi>by him,</hi> ſo ought our <hi>living</hi> to be purely and onely <hi>to him,</hi> not (as it is, God help us) to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> as if we had been our own makers, or could (for the leaſt minute) preſerve our ſelves; how daring ſo ever our comportment is, as though we were our own and not God Almighties creatures, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing dayly to our ſelves, ſinning hourely, and provoking God to undo his own handy work, by damning (not annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating) of us, were not his mercy above our malice, which malice onely can attempt our annihilation. I need ſay no more of the excellency of this Prayer; for whileſt I ſtrive to amplifie it by other words, I do contract it rather, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it; which is more patheticall and ſignificant in the ſhort method it obſerves, then any ampliation (even by the tongues or pens of Angels) can make it: and ſhewes us, That as God is but one ſimple eſſence in himſelf, yet contains within him all the variety that is poſſible in infinite millions of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; (or worlds indeed) ſo he can, if he pleaſe, contract
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:204830:380"/> into one word, the ſenſe and meaning of all the languages of the world: and truly much is contracted in this Prayer above.

Now becauſe God Almighty did foreſee, how apt a man would be to flatter himſelf, that he was bound by the Law of Nature to pamper that fleſh which he had received from his Natural Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and conſequently might looſe his ſoul by ſo pampering of his body; therefore he was mercifully pleaſed, by making man enter into better bonds, (thoſe of holy baptiſme) to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell all his former debts to any creature whatſoever, and to make him become new debtour, only to that holy Spirit which was both his Creatour, (and ſo had more right in him then his fleſhly Parents had) and alſo his Regeneratour, and ſo begot him to <hi>a ſpiritual life,</hi> or being, which his firſt beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were not able to confer upon him.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. But S. Paul, not content to tell us in this Epiſtle that <hi>we are onely debtours to the Spirit,</hi> and the reaſon why, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the bond we entered into at holy baptiſme of loving God above all things, and of living wholly unto him) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to animate us towards the performance of <hi>this debt,</hi> by ſhewing us the gallant effect thereof, namely, that it makes us as well the <hi>heires</hi> as <hi>ſons of God,</hi> and not <hi>heires</hi> onely, but <hi>co-heires of Chriſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. Now in regard the Preachers office is to tell us how to pay this debt, how to live ſpiritually, and by ſo living to ſecure ourſelves of this ineffable co-heiretage; (which office the Expoſitours upon this holy Text have at leaſt in part ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed) therefore it remained onely that our holy Mother the Church ſhould make us ſuch a Prayer, as might be moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this doctrine; and none ſo ſuiting it as that, which begs our <hi>thoughts may be rightly</hi> ſuch as ſuggeſt to operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:204830:382"/> anſwerable to our beeing, ſpiritual altogether: That ſo, as it was a pure act of love in God to adopt us here his children in Grace, we, by re-loving him (that is by living according to our better being) may be yet further adopted his children in Glory, and thus may be made the <hi>co-heires of Chriſt</hi> indeed.</p>
                           <p>Say now the Prayer above, and ſee beloved, if it be not moſt appoſite to this holy purpoſe.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THis <hi>parable</hi> ſhewes, that all Chriſtians bear office of Truſt in Gods Church, and are onely to adminiſter his goods, not to <hi>waſte,</hi> or uſe them as their own; and this is meant, whether they have <hi>goods</hi> of nature, or of grace, they are to account for all to him: And our <hi>accuſer</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is the devil, who juſtly layes <hi>waste</hi> to our charge, as well when we uſe not Gods gifts well, as when we uſe them ill. So ſtill Chriſtians muſt <hi>do good,</hi> and not onely <hi>decline evil,</hi> elſe they lye liable to the devils accuſations.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. O how clement a Maſter do we ſerve! how gently he rebukes, when even in Juſtice he is bound to take an account of our perfidiouſneſſe! Where he ſayes, <hi>now thou muſt not be longer Bailiffe,</hi> is underſtood, I cannot in juſtice let thee be longer in truſt of my goods, then whileſt thou doeſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter them faithfully. An excellent leſſon to keep us cloſe to our duties.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <pb n="146" facs="tcp:204830:383"/>3. We ſee here the accuſation is not falſe, the <hi>Bailiffe</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not that, he confeſſeth his guilt when he asks <hi>what ſhall I do?</hi> ſince he cannot hope for longer truſt from his maſter. This puts us in mind of our miſerable condition at the latter account, in reſpect whereof it followes, there is no ability in us to labour amends by further ſervice; for then the time, as well as the power of further labour is paſt: and to beg re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of any other maſter is a ſhame to man, that had ſo good a maſter of Almighty God, whoſe favour he hath loſt for ever.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. This verſe ſhewes <hi>the Bailiffe</hi> had reſolved with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to cheat his maſter; ſo to provide for himſelf by their means, whom he had favoured to his maſters preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. 6. 7. Theſe verſes need not explanation, as ſhewing only how much he cheated his maſter of.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Note, the word <hi>Lord</hi> here is taken for <hi>the Bailiffes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> not for our Saviour, as ſome miſtake it: and truly the context proves as much; for our Saviour undertakes to tell this ſtory, as in the perſon of another man; ſo he cannot mean himſelf, when he ſayes <hi>the Lord,</hi> but muſt needs mean the <hi>Bailiffes</hi> real <hi>maſter</hi> did <hi>praiſe</hi> his own <hi>Bailiffe</hi> of <hi>iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that is, did commend the invention or manner of the cheat, not the cheat it ſelf; and ſaid that <hi>the children of this world</hi> uſed more wiſdome and prudence in their worldly wayes, then <hi>the children of light.</hi> This may put us in mind, how ill it is that we ſtudy more to damne, then to ſave our ſoules.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. This verſe cleares the ſenſe of the former to be ſpoken in the name of the <hi>maſter</hi> to the <hi>Bailiffe;</hi> for here Chriſt, having told us that <hi>maſters</hi> ſenſe, now makes profeſſion to ſpeak in his own name in theſe words, <hi>I ſay unto you</hi> give almes, do good deeds unto the poor with your <hi>Mammon of iniquity,</hi> (your treaſures) for by vertue of theſe almes the poor may plead your admittance into heaven, and obtain (by their interceſſion) that your almes may cover a multitude of your ſins. So this is a <hi>parable</hi> ſpeaking properly to rich men
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:204830:383"/> of this world, who are not true Lords of their own eſtates, but owe them to God, and have the portions of the poor in their hands; and own all their treaſure, but as <hi>Lords of iniquity,</hi> as heapers up of wealth, which they have cheated the poor of; and when they pay them not by Almes, they lye lyable to the like cenſure of this <hi>Bailiffe,</hi> (to render account) for they are ſuch to God.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THis Goſpel being wholly <hi>Parabolical,</hi> we are at the greater liberty to make our applications thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we can beſt avail our ſelves by it, further then what by the Illuſtration and Explication above is already done. Firſt therefore, albeit this <hi>Parable</hi> aymes directly at rectifying the inordinate exceſſes of Rich men, who abuſe the truſt God hath repoſed in them of relieving the poor, when they laviſh away their eſtates vainly, and do not (by their <hi>charities</hi>) pay the poor mens Portions, which are included in the rich mens revenues: yet we may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry properly here mind the Prieſts of Gods holy Church, that as they are indeed the chief <hi>Bailiffes</hi> of their heavenly Maſter, truſted with more of his Eſtate and Treaſure then all the world beſides, namely, the receiving and diſtributing his holy graces; (the livelyhoods of their own and other mens ſoules) ſo when they waſte theſe Treaſures, either by their own idle miſpending them, or by their undue diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to others, eſpecially by palliating the ſins of the people, and flattering them with needleſſe diſpenſations from their Chriſtian duties, (never valid but when really neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) then are they moſt properly ſuch ill <hi>Bailiffes</hi> as this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſpecifies.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Secondly, in regard there is no Lay-man free from the <hi>Bailifſhip</hi> of a huge (though leſſer) truſt alſo repoſed in him by Almighty God, of all thoſe rich graces, vertues, and gifts which are beſtowed upon us in holy <hi>Baptiſme;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every Lay-man (as well as the Prieſt) may piouſly fear
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:204830:384"/> he playes this ill <hi>Bailiffes</hi> part; and that chiefly out of this root, his giving way to unjuſt thoughts, ſuch as propend him to unrighteous actions, by not being rejected, but diſputed with, untill the temptation of ſordid gain or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure overcome him, and make him unjuſtly act that, which at firſt was but <hi>unrightly</hi> thought.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Now this evil holy Church hopes to amend in us by prayer adapted to the <hi>Bailifſhip</hi> we are intruſted with, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of our own ſoules, and partly of our neighbours too, (in point of edification to him at leaſt) whereby we are <hi>charitably</hi> to contribute alſo to his ſalvation: which we ſhall then perform in <hi>act,</hi> if our thoughts be firſt ſet upon the <hi>doing</hi> it. Thus we ſee, how the debt we owe of <hi>charity</hi> to our neighbour, puts us in mind of the greater debt we owe thereof unto our ſelves, and to Almighty God.

Paul here minds the Chriſtian Corinthians, who it ſeems were alſo inclined to make idols of their own deſires, rather then to adore (in true ſpirit) the living God, or ſeek his holy will: as alſo S. Luke in the Goſpel tells us, the whole city of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ill addicted; wherein were not onely ſlain twenty three thouſand perſons at the ſacking thereof by
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:204830:385"/> the Romans, but even in the deſtruction of that city, the whole nation of the Jews was diſperſed and overthrown, for perſecuting Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe he came not to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own deſire, according as they had fancied to themſelves the Meſſias ſhould come, in power and glory, in riches and abundance; the very thought of which iniquity in the Jews made <hi>Jeſus weep,</hi> as S. Luke tells us, ſo ſoon as he ſaw the moſt ſplendid and opulent city of the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe near to her deſtruction, for want of following ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as we have in this dayes prayer; for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the will of God; for <hi>want of deſiring and asking thoſe things, that were pleaſing</hi> to the Divine Majeſty. And to ſhew how ſhort they were of uſing this form of prayer, we ſee he went immediately to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and chaſed out thoſe from thence, who <hi>made the houſe of prayer a den of thieves;</hi> of ſuch as under colour to ſell neceſſaries for the ſacrifices of the <hi>Temple,</hi> ſold their God himſelf for hope of ſordid gain; who therefore were called <hi>thieves,</hi> as robbing God of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, even in that place which was ſacred to his ſervice, by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more their own profit then his glory in that place.

                           <p n="6">6. O How much are Chriſtians obliged to Almighty God, who hath laid before them the puniſhments of his own elect people, (the children of Iſrael) not onely for a <hi>figure,</hi> but an example alſo unto them; that by the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted on the Hebrews, we Chriſtians might beware, and avoid ſuch ſinnes, as we ſee God did not pardon in his own choſen people, but puniſhed them ſeverely!</p>
                           <p n="7">7. When they erected themſelves an idol of a golden calf, and adored it, and afterwards like the Egyptians and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles made great feaſts, wherein they wanted not exceſſes at their tables, and then <hi>roſe</hi> to their wanton ſports and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, as if they would thereby honour their <hi>Idoll.</hi> Which profaneneſſe was puniſhed by Moyſes, commanding his Levites to kill at once three and twenty thouſand of them. And this S. Paul inculcates to the Corinthians, and to all diſſolute Chriſtians to day: For as the Corinthians had certain dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of thouſands of virgins to Venus, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured under pretended honour to her; ſo this was a fit exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of S. Paul to them, and may be to all our wanton youth, God help them.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Here S. Paul alludes to the abomirable <hi>idolatry</hi> that was committted to <hi>Bel-phcor,</hi> that is, unto <hi>Priapus,</hi> with the daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> abuſed in honour of this horrid <hi>Idol-god;</hi> which was puniſhed as above is noted in the gloſſe upon the former verſe: where the like puniſhment was inflicted upon the <hi>idolaters</hi> to the calf, as is here mentioned upon the <hi>fornicatours;</hi> onely that there were mentioned twenty four thouſand, Numb. 25. v. 5. here onely twenty three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; So the Apoſtle ſpeaks with the leaſt; not that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the other place of Scripture, ſince the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber includes the leſſer, though the leſſer doth not exclude the greater.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Here the Apoſtle calls <hi>tempting</hi> diſtruſting in Chriſt; as it ſeems ſome of the Corinthians did, who doubted of his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:204830:387"/> 
                              <hi>reſurrection:</hi> for where in the Old Teſtament we read Num. 25.5. the children of Iſrael are ſaid to <hi>murmure</hi> againſt the Lord; S. Paul here applies this to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and calls it <hi>tempting</hi> of him in the Corinthians, as in that <hi>figure</hi> the Iſraelites did, who periſhed by <hi>fiery ſerpents,</hi> Num. 21. v. 6. not that they were <hi>fiery,</hi> but becauſe the effect of their ſting was as hot as <hi>fire,</hi> and ſeemd to burn the people that were ſtung or bitten by them</p>
                           <p n="10">10. <hi>Their periſhing</hi> was partly being ſwallowed up alive by the earth, partly being burned with fire from heaven, or ſmitten with the ſword of the Angel, called in this verſe <hi>the deſtroyer,</hi> and conceived by the beſt Interpreters to be S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael, the leader of the people, and the giver of the Law unto them in the <hi>mount Sinai,</hi> and in that <hi>the figure</hi> of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt. And indeed Gods puniſhments were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and very ſevere upon the ſinne of <hi>murmure</hi> againſt his Divine Majeſty.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. That is, <hi>all things</hi> here ſpecified, not abſolutely <hi>all</hi> that are written in the whole ancient law: for however many <hi>things</hi> were there <hi>figurative,</hi> yet there were alſo many <hi>things</hi> not <hi>figurative,</hi> but had their own end in themſelves, without relation to any <hi>thing</hi> that was to follow. And here the word <hi>figure</hi> is not taken ſtrictly, ſo as to mean allegory or myſtery, but rather indeed for <hi>example;</hi> ſince in that ſenſe S. Paul applies it to us in the Corinthians, as appears by his following words, that <hi>they were written for our correction,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, or admonition. By <hi>the ends of the world</hi> in this place is underſtood the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whoſe time is often called <hi>the laſt hour,</hi> both in the Old and the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this <hi>hour</hi> is to be meaſured from the birth of our Saviour till his coming to judgement, becauſe to millions of ſouls it hath been already their <hi>laſt hour,</hi> and will be to many more, ſince there is no more time to work ſalvation in, then that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his birth and his coming to judgement.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. This verſe ſeems added leſt any ſhould conceive, the former menaces did not belong to him in particular; for ſuch is the condition of humane frailty, that who to day is a Saint, may tomorrow be a ſinner; and therefore the Apoſtle bids us all ſtand upon our guard.</p>
                           <p n="13">
                              <pb n="155" facs="tcp:204830:387"/>13. This Greek phraſe of the imperative moode, <hi>Let not</hi> &amp;c. is to be underſtood in the Latine and Engliſh, as if it were in the preterperfect tenſe of the indicative, and would ſay <hi>hath not;</hi> that is, the temptations you have had, were but mere humane, namely to contention, to luſt, to liberty, and the like, ſuch as are common to all mankind, but are eaſily avoyded by the help of grace beſtowed on us, by <hi>our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God,</hi> who, as the following words aſſure us, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert us in our <hi>temptations,</hi> nor let <hi>us be tempted above our ſtrength:</hi> much leſſe doth God (as Calvin ſayes) thruſt us on, or <hi>tempt</hi> us himſelf; nor doth he (as Luther will have it) impoſe things impoſſible on us, to whom his grace (as to Saint Paul it was) <hi>is all ſufficient,</hi> and from whom he never takes the ſaid grace, till we reject it, or by our conſent to ſin expell it. Contrary, God permits us not to be <hi>tempted,</hi> but that we may thereby gain greater force to endure yet further aſſaults; as who ſhould ſay, the <hi>iſſue</hi> of our <hi>temptation</hi> is (if we will) our victory, and inabling us to a new, (if need be) to a greater combat; for thus much import the laſt words of the verſe, that <hi>we may be able to ſustain</hi> theſe, and yet greater onſets, if we will our ſelves uſe the grace which God gives us to reſiſt them with.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THe ſumme of this Epiſtle is to tell us Chriſtians, that what puniſhments were inflicted on the little children of Almighty God, the Jewes, who had onely the Alphabet, the Elements of religion beſtowed upon them, will (if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like ſins) befall us too, that a e the Men, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants, the Champions of Jeſus Chriſt, honoured by him ſo far as to have the perfection of religion taught us by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: not onely in the delivery of his holy word unto us; but in the example of his ſacred perſon, doing before our eyes much more then he expects from us, becauſe we ſhould have no excuſe from doing our endeavours, in ſome ſort at leaſt to follow his ſaving footſteps.</p>

It will therefore behove us, that are now marching our long journey through the deſert of this world to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven upon the feet of Chriſtian <hi>charity,</hi> to behave our ſelves as we were paſſing ſome narrow and looſe bridge ſtanding o're a precipice of deepeſt waters, full of rocks ſure to paſh us in peices, or to drown us if we fall: for to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection the 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="3">3. O beloved, if this be the frequent practiſe of Chriſtians (who pretend <hi>charity</hi> to be their guide) how ought the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to ſtrike us into a religious awe, into a holy fear, into a dread indeed leſt while we make a ſhew to men of ſaintity, we practiſe iniquity! And therefore holy Church to day hath made a prayer ſo excellently ſuiting to this purpoſe, that it alone, ſaid with a heart which beats according to the lip that ſaies it, will ſuffice to cure us of thoſe evils, and to ſecure our <hi>charity</hi> ſhe ſhall hold her footing o're the narrow bridge of danger; <q>If while ſhe prayes ſhe perfectly renounce her own deſires, and beg of God Almighty only that which is <hi>agreable</hi> unto his holy will and <hi>pleaſure.</hi>

HEre our Saviour ſhewed the tender bowels of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, when <hi>drawing near</hi> Jeruſalem, (the head city of his own choſen people, whither he was ſent by his heavenly Father to redeem them, and all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides) &amp; ſeeing (by his al-ſeeing eye) that maugre the exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the children and people, who ſhewed his way into the City, yet he ſhould by the chief commanders there be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in requital of his love; he fell a <hi>weeping,</hi> mixing the wine
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:204830:389"/> of his triumph with the water of his tears, to ſhew us how to temper our pleaſures here. Three cauſes there were of our Saviours <hi>tears</hi> upon this city; The firſt, the blindneſſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duracy, and ingratitude of his choſen people, that would not receive their <hi>Meſſias</hi> and Saviour: The ſecond, the revenge of God upon them by Titus, who was to be their deſtruction by this ingratitude: The third, the loſſe, as it were, of all his own labours upon his beſt beloved children, moſt of the ſons of that city.</p>
                           <p n="42">42. That is, <hi>if thou</hi> (o my beloved city) <hi>didst know,</hi> as I do, <hi>and that in this thy day,</hi> (when I come to give thee a kiſſe of peace from heaven, being ſent unto thee by my eternall Father) when I enter thy gates to redeem and ſave thee, which is indeed <hi>a thing appertaining to thy eternall peace:</hi> And here, to ſhew the exceſſe of his grief, he ſtops, and ſayes not what ſhould follow, to wit, thou wouldeſt <hi>weep</hi> thy ſelfe, as I doe now for thee, thou wouldeſt <hi>weep</hi> to ſee what pains I have taken in my three years preaching of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to thee, what more I am to take for thee, whileſt I die to ſave thee, who wilt not be ſaved: Yes, all this ſenſe runs through our Saviours ſoul, and is genuinely taken out of this abrupt ſpeech; which becauſe I ſee, and thou doſt not, (wilt not indeed) therefore <hi>I weeep</hi> for thee, O wretched city.</p>

So ſenſibly our Saviour ſpeaks of this cities deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that here he ſeems to exaggerate; for it is not credible the Romans were either ſo curious, or ſo idle as not to leave <hi>a stone upon a ſtone,</hi> ſince there is now in that new city the old mount Calvary, where many ſtones lay one upon the other. So the meaning of this place is, that the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of this city ſhould be ſo great, as if there had not been <hi>a ſtone left upon a ſtone</hi> within it, whileſt thoſe that were left, ſhould be of no
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:204830:389"/> uſe nor profit. By <hi>the time of the viſitation</hi> underſtand this very <hi>time,</hi> when our Saviour came a loving <hi>Meſſias</hi> to ſave this city, and ſhe would not receive him, but plotted his death in requitall.</p>

It was not amiſſe to begin viſibly to reform the viſible abuſes in the Temple, eſpecially ſince he ſee the hearts and ſouls of the high Prieſts would not be reformed by him.</p>
                           <p n="46">46. This was ſo palpable an abuſe of the <hi>written word,</hi> that none could queſtion it; and beſides it was neceſſary to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh open Sacriledge, where there was to be eſtabliſhed open Sanctity.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. HOw excellently wel doth holy Church follow her deſign in this Goſpel, which we perceive ſhe had in the Epiſtle above! For what elſe is meant by <hi>Jeſus weeping over Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and foretelling her deſtruction, but becauſe ſhe did to him while he marcht before her eyes, as we have heard her children did to God while he mercifully led them through the red Sea, (and many other dangers) out of Egypt into the land of promiſe. What was their <hi>buying and ſelling in the Temple</hi> other then <hi>Idolatry to Mammon,</hi> other then rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing God of that honour which they paid (even in his own houſe) unto his greateſt enemy the devill? For which you ſee our Saviour whipt them out of the Temple, as was ſaid in the Illuſtration above, and not unneceſſarily repeated here.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. O Catholick Chriſtians! how do we act this Jewiſh

While inſtead of renouncing the vanity of the world, we ſell even God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for hope of onely popular applauſe, by frequenting the Church for vain reſpects, to ſee, and to be ſeen, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of praying there, or of hearing the word of God; which is to make <hi>Gods holy Houſe, a denne of thieves,</hi> to rob him of his honour in that very place appointed onely for honouring, and adoring of his holy Name.</p>

THis whole Goſpel is ſumm'd up in theſe few words of the Publican, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> For we ſee there is nothing elſe aym'd at in the whole Text but a condemnation of the Phariſees pride, and a commendation of the Publicans humility; or rather of his humble charity: That is ſuch a love as renounceth all proper merit, and hath recourſe to nothing but the <hi>mercy of Almighty God;</hi> ſuch a love as likes, but dares not <hi>look to heaven;</hi> ſuch a love as hates all ſin, but hath no other hope of ſayntity then from the <hi>mercy of God Almighty;</hi> ſuch a love as believes God hath power to ſave a ſoul, but that he cannot <hi>manifeſt this Power</hi> without his mercy firſt appear, becauſe he cannot ſave a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, unleſſe he mercifully give him firſt leave to repent his ſins.</p>

We may ſay (with much more reaſon) of mans ſalvation, as the Romans did of erecting their Empire, <hi>Tantae molis erat</hi>— O what a huge attempt it was to ſet up the Roman Nation, and to make them Monarchs of this world! So if we look upon the final end of God Almighties exerciſed power, and multiplyed mercies over us, it is meerly to ſave his Chriſtian people, meerly to make them Monarchs of the next world, eternal Emperours, everlaſting Triumphers over
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:204830:396"/> death, ſin, devil and damnation, after they had been ſlaves to them four thouſand years together. Nay, ſo fond Almighty God is of his darling man, that he is even content to beſtow his utmoſt <hi>Power,</hi> his extended <hi>omnipotency, his multiplyed mercies</hi> on him to beget but a deſire in him onely of his own felicity, which conſiſts in the promiſes of the next world, not in the poſſeſſions of this.</p>

Paul, and other Apoſtles to preach unto us the ſtory of his <hi>life, paſſion, death,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection?</hi> were not theſe works of his <hi>pity exceeding as well the merits, as the deſires of his ſuppliants,</hi> when no mortal durſt have <hi>deſired</hi> ſo much miſery to Chriſt, becauſe no man was able to <hi>deſerve</hi> his God ſhould ſuffer ſo much for him? were not then <hi>the mercies of Heaven poured</hi> out upon us, when our redemption was purchaſed at ſo deare a rate to Jeſus Chriſt? and was not St. Paul juſtly afraid ſomething might lurk <hi>in his conſcience unforgiven,</hi> when he ends this dayes Epiſtle ſaying, his <hi>having perſecuted the Church of God made him unworthy</hi> to <hi>be called an Apoſtle,</hi> and that ſince he <hi>was what he was by the grace of God,</hi> he durſt not preſume to ask ſo great a favour? O, how literally is this whole Epiſtle exhauſted in this excellent Prayer! And what are the cures done upon the <hi>deaf,</hi> and <hi>dumb</hi> related in the Goſpel, but an abundance of like <hi>pity</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt? but like exceſſe of <hi>his mercy poured out upon theſe diſeaſed people?</hi> what the amazement in the beholders of theſe miracles cloſing up the ſaid Goſpel, but an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment that the guilt of their <hi>conſciences</hi> made them <hi>afraid</hi> to be in the preſence of ſo good a God, and that the grant of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:204830:397"/> the cure was a thing added freely by Chriſt, as done in more ample manner then <hi>they durst preſume to aske</hi> though with a faint deſire, and a fainter <hi>faith</hi> they had preſented thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed people to our Saviour to be cured? Say now, beloved, was I raſh in falling upon this bold attempt, to ſhew a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy between the Prayers of holy Church, and the preaching part of her Services? Rather I am to ask God pardon that I did often doubt it was not true, becauſe I was many times too lazy to beat it out by way of meditation: but now that I ſee the thing is certainly true, I ſhall not be troubled if I fail at any time in ſo clear a demonſtration of it as deeper ſouls may make, encouraged by theſe beginnings of my ſhallow under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Mean while I ſhall beſeech our whole <hi>ſodality</hi> to ſay theſe Prayers with all devotion poſſible, as being ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that rightly underſtood do raviſh any tender ſoul, and will make them ſee the fondneſſe of a ſingle-ſoled devotion, in compariſon of this which is the Univerſall Churches Prayer. Let me conclude with this one queſtion onely; tell me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, what we may not <hi>da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>e to aske</hi> of God Almighty, who in this dayes prayer are bid demand <hi>more</hi> then we <hi>dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to aske.</hi> And why? becauſe no <hi>guilt of conſcience</hi> is ſo great, but he that is the ſearcher of our hearts can <hi>ſee</hi> the depth thereof, and ſeeing, <hi>mercifully</hi> pardon it through the <hi>abundance of his pitty</hi> towards us: nay then he commonly gives a more ample pardon when we acknowledge his <hi>mercy exceeds</hi> as much our <hi>deſires,</hi> as it doth our <hi>merits;</hi> when we rely upon him for prevenient grace to ask him pardon for our ſinnes, and that done, with a ſoul contrite, then build upon his goodneſſe for the reſt; when we leave it to him what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>mercy</hi> he will ſhow us, ſince he being God cannot give ſo little, but it is much more then we his creatures can deſerve, and ſince his goodneſſe is ſuch as he cannot chuſe but give more then he bids us aske, ſince we muſt alwayes ask as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting creatures, he alwayes gives as an abounding Creatour, giving all things to nothing rather then want a ſubject to beſtow his bounties on; and we are leſſe then nothing when he gives repentance to our ſinfull ſouls. O! this, beloved,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:204830:397"/> is the <hi>pouring out of his mercy,</hi> this is the out-doing good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Almighty God, which in the prayer above we ſo much magnifie, and in ſo doing glorifie his bleſſed name; whence we may one day hope to ſee our bliſſe, our glory flowing alſo, ſince therefore God is glorified here in time, that he may render us in heaven glorious for all eternity.</p>

                           <head>The Explication.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. THat is, I call again here to your mind: (So runs the Greek Text, where the Vulgar ſayes, we are <hi>given to underſtand.</hi>)</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Meaning, if you work according to your belief: ſo here faith without works was preached by Saint Paul <hi>to be vain;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, no <hi>faith</hi> were ſaving but that <hi>which by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is operative.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. Hence it is clear, the Apoſtle did firſt deliver by word of mouth the doctrine which he after writ: ſo by <hi>tradition</hi> we come firſt (and chiefly) to Chriſtianitie; by preaching, not by writing, for <hi>faith is by hearing:</hi> Rom. 10.17. And whereas here we read of <hi>delivery,</hi> the Greeks write <hi>tradition,</hi> and that <hi>according to the Scriptures.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. That is, as was literally foretold by the figure of Jonas three dayes in the Whales belly; allegorically of Iſaac deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſafe to his mother three dayes after he had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from death, though offered up thereunto by Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. By <hi>Cephas</hi> underſtand <hi>Peter,</hi> who was the firſt man Chriſt appeared to, though he had before appeared to Mary Magdalene, as we read Mark the laſt, v. 9. Then to the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven Apostles:</hi> That was in the Octave of Eaſter, when Saint Thomas was alſo preſent; for at firſt he appeared onely to the other ten; though the Greeks read <hi>to twelve,</hi> meaning
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:204830:398"/> to the whole Colledge of Apoſtles; which may ſtand good though one, or two were abſent, as an act is ſaid to be the whole Councills act, when it is paſt by the greater number.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. <hi>He was ſeen</hi> to thoſe <hi>five hundred</hi> as in the aire, or from ſome high place that all might ſee him at once, to ſhew them rather then to tell them he was riſen; for it is not ſaid in this Text that he ſpoke to any of theſe <hi>five hundred</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And it is moſt probable this <hi>apparition</hi> was in the mountain of Galilee, which was by our Saviour foretold, ſo that this company probably went thither purpoſely, and as foretold what would happen. This <hi>apparition</hi> was before the Aſcenſion, for this mountain was in Galilee, not in Judaea as was the mount Olivet whence our Saviour did aſcend.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. This was an <hi>apparition</hi> of ſpeciall favour to Saint <hi>James</hi> of Alphaeus, called the brother of Chriſt, and ſucceeding him in his <hi>ſea at Hieruſalem.</hi> So our Saviour was not content once onely (and that in common) to appear unto Saint <hi>James</hi> with the reſt of the Apoſtles, (and peradventure with the five hundred in the verſe above) but he was pleaſed ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to grace his brother, (ſo called becauſe he was like our Saviour) by a private appearing to him after theſe publick <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions</hi> to him, and others.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Saint Paul calls himſelf <hi>abortive,</hi> becauſe he was born to the Apoſtolate after the time of Chriſt his chooſing his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, by a ſpeciall calling even from heaven, after Chriſt had <hi>aſcended</hi> to his heavenly Father: So S. Ambroſe, and S. Chryſoſtome expound it. Yet there want not other pious expoſitions of this word by other Fathers; as if by this S. Paul would render himſelf leſſe conſiderable; So the next verſe clearly ſaies, and needs no further expoſition.</p>
                           <p n="9">9, 10. <hi>By the grace of God I am an Apoſtle,</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of the Gentiles; and this <hi>grace hath not been void,</hi> idle or lazie in me, but operative according to the diligence of a ſoul inflamed with the love of God, and making his free will a ſervant to <hi>grace,</hi> by acting freely what by holy inſpirations he was called unto.</p>
                           <pb n="178" facs="tcp:204830:399"/>
                           <p>The Epiſtle ends at <hi>void,</hi> but the verſe goes on as above.</p>
                           <p>He ſaies <hi>more aboundantly then all they;</hi> this may ſeem an ill arrogancy after ſo much humiliation of himſelf; but it is not ſo; for by <hi>more aboundantly</hi> he means onely by overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more vice; (not that he profeſſed more virtue) namely the vice of a <hi>perſecuter</hi> which was in none but himſelf; though <hi>more</hi> may be attributed to his doing as much in a leſſe time as the reſt did in longer ſpace, being he was laſt called. <hi>With me,</hi> that is, laboureth with me, and not as the Heretickes tranſlate, <hi>the grace which is with me,</hi> or, <hi>in me,</hi> I not laboring my ſelf, but relying on the paſt labours of Chriſt: thus vainly they; but the holy Church underſtands the Apoſtle to mean his joynt labour with the grace of God.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div type="application">
                           <head>The Application.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul in this Epiſtle recapitulates the arguments by which he brought the Corinthians to believe the hardeſt point of Faith that then was agitated; <hi>the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of our Saviour; for it was upon preaching that doctrine this Apoſtle was chiefly perſecuted, and for defence whereof he ſuffered martyrdome.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. But as we ſee this Epiſtle in the beginning requires <hi>that charity</hi> accompany the <hi>faith</hi> of this great myſtery, ſo in the cloſe thereof <hi>humility</hi> attends on <hi>charity,</hi> while S. Paul firſt calls himſelf <hi>an abortive,</hi> and <hi>the leaſt of the Apoſtles,</hi> more, one <hi>not worthy</hi> of that celebrated Name, nor daring to aſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf the fruits of any his greateſt labours, but attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all <hi>to the grace of God</hi> effectually <hi>operating</hi> in him all thoſe things, whereunto he thought himſelf did very poorly cooperate. Thus muſt <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> accompany our <hi>charity</hi> in her now long march to Advent, in all her way to Judgement it ſelf.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. What can be the reſult of this myſtery, other then that which naturally followes the unexpected proof of the leaſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:204830:399"/> expected, and moſt unbelieved thing in all the world, the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Saviour? <hi>A joy</hi> no doubt ineffable in thoſe that were his friends, and had no hand in any of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and a <hi>confuſion</hi> on the other ſide in all that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto his death; a ſorrow and a fear, if not a deep deſpair indeed that their ſinne of <hi>Deicide</hi> was ſure enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable. So ſhould it be with us, beloved, who although we cannot kill our Chriſt again, yet do attempt to crucifie him, by the very leaſt of many mortall ſinnes that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit againſt his heavenly Majeſty; notwithſtanding our own <hi>conſcience</hi> tells us, we doe therein worſe then ever did the Jewes, for they pretended zeal in all they did, whereas we know we ſinne for want of zeal, for want of <hi>love</hi> to him, who died for love of us. What remedy, but that which holy Church to day hath found? when we hear the Preachers tell us of the frights and feares, the ſadneſſe, and confuſion of the Jewes in ſuch a caſe, that then <q>We pray not onely, as we did on Sunday laſt, to have <hi>Gods mercy multiplyed,</hi> but even <hi>powred</hi> out upon us, as his precious bloud was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the Jewes; that by ſuch a ſhowre of <hi>mercy</hi> the ſinnes our <hi>conſcience fears</hi> may be <hi>pardoned,</hi> and the favours we <hi>dare not aske</hi> may be granted, for the reaſons given in the preamble of the Prayer, and in the end of the Illuſtration above.</q>

                           <p n="31">31. THis literall narration of Chriſt going <hi>from coaſt to coaſt,</hi> and by the Sea ſide, alludeth to the change which grace maketh in thoſe who follow the calling of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that they muſt leave their former cuſtomes, and go by new <hi>coasts,</hi> even rough and dangerous ſeas of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:204830:400"/> up mountains of dangers, and difficulties to enjoy the quiet of a good conſcience.</p>
                           <p n="32">32. By <hi>deaf</hi> underſtand myſtically thoſe who will not obey the commands of God, and holy Church: by <hi>dumbe,</hi> thoſe who will not praiſe Almighty God in their actions, nor in their thoughts, but like mutes ſpend their time in ſilencing Gods praiſes. They ask him <hi>to lay his hands on them,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had experience he did uſe to cure the diſeaſed by that means.</p>
                           <p n="33">33. <hi>He tooke him apart,</hi> becauſe this corporall cure alludes to the converſion of the ſoul; and the beſt means of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God is an averſion from the world, a retyring from evill company. By <hi>his fingers put into the deaf mans eares,</hi> underſtand the holy Ghoſt opening the infidels underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and making him believe the word of God when he hears it. Beſides, the holy Ghoſt is often intimated by the <hi>finger</hi> of God, as Ex. 8.19. <hi>&amp; alibi.</hi> By <hi>ſpitting</hi> here is meant Chriſt his wetting his own finger with his own <hi>ſpittle,</hi> ſo notes the Greek Text, not that he did <hi>ſpit</hi> into the <hi>dumb</hi> mans mouth. And Chriſt his <hi>ſpittle</hi> is not an unfit cure of <hi>dumbneſſe,</hi> ſince by the moiſture of the tongue ſpeech is much perfected, and aridity is an impediment to ſpeech. Thus even God works miracles by the apteſt inſtruments in nature for them.</p>
                           <p n="34">34. By his <hi>looking to heaven,</hi> we are minded that from thence comes all the power we have to heare the word of God, and to ſpeak his praiſe. By his <hi>groaning</hi> he ſhowes how God ſeems to lament the miſeries of thoſe ſouls which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the contagion of ſin. By his ſaying <hi>Epheta</hi> (be thou open) to the <hi>deaf ear,</hi> he ſhewes himſelf to be God, as curing by command.</p>
                           <p n="35">35. No marvel God commanding the cure was done, but by his <hi>ſpeaking right</hi> we are told the cure was perfectly done, and not palliated. And indeed then it is moſt evident Gods operation is perfect in us, when it brings us from <hi>wrong</hi> to <hi>right,</hi> from ſick to ſound; but myſtically, when from ſinners we are brought to be <hi>right perfected Saints:</hi> and ſurely needs muſt he <hi>ſpeak right</hi> whom God had cured of his <hi>dumbneſſe.</hi>
                              <pb n="182" facs="tcp:204830:401"/> Though ſome will have it hence, that this man was not quite <hi>dumb,</hi> but had onely a ſtammering in his ſpeech, or a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in that organ, not ſuffering him to ſpeak plain, but to babble as children do that firſt learn to ſpeak. Yet by <hi>right ſpeaking</hi> may here be well underſtood, the cured mans ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly the praiſes of God, and rightly glorifying his Divine Majeſty thereby.</p>
                           <p n="36">36. The word <hi>command</hi> here is not to be taken ſtrictly, or arguing a precept, but rather a requeſt: ſo there was no ſin in breaking it, but rather, as S. Auguſtine inſinuates, a virtue, and that <hi>obedience</hi> too; for he admires the art of Chriſts <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> to ſpeak here, under the precept of ſilence: theſe are S. Auguſtines words <hi>lib. de conſenſ. Evang:</hi> 
                              <q>Our Lord by prohibiting would teach and inform us, with how great fervour they upon whom he impoſeth his <hi>commands</hi> ought to preach him, when as thoſe that were forbidden could not hold their peace.</q> No marvel then if the more they are thus forbid, the more they preach his praiſes. His <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding</hi> them to <hi>tell no body,</hi> was rather for inſtruction, then to have any reall force of a <hi>command</hi> upon the parties healed; becauſe the intent of this commanding ſilence was, that when by Gods peculiar grace we are enabled to do any good, or lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable action, we ſhould rather ſuppreſſe, then ſpread it abroad, leſt thereby we be vaingloriouſly moved to arrogate unto our ſelves the praiſe of the action, which is due to Almighty God as the principal agent, while we are onely inſtrumental there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                           <p n="37">37. They had indeed reaſon to <hi>wonder</hi> at his modeſty who forbad it, and at their gratitude who could not forbear to ſpeak his praiſes that had <hi>done all things</hi> ſo <hi>well</hi> which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, as himſelf could not afterwards hinder them in a manner from well doing to publiſh his wondrous works. It is a ſign Chriſt did not effectively <hi>command</hi> them to ſilence, ſince the more he bade them hold their peace, the more they publiſhed his praiſes: For indeed had it been his pleaſure they ſhould have been ſilent, they would as little have ſpoken againſt his will, (even after the tongue was by him untyed,)
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:204830:401" rendition="simple:additions"/> as they could ſpeak before he had untyed the ſame: but to ſhew us even Gods temporal bleſſings have ſpiritual influences upon us; therefore after their corporal cures theſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came advanced in ſpirit, <hi>in faith, in hope, in love</hi> of Almighty God, as appeared by their frank uttering of his praiſes unto all the world, and ſhewing in their doing well towards God, that God had done <hi>all things well</hi> in them, as this text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth, when he had cured their infidelity of ſoules together with the diſeaſes of their bodies.</p>

                              <pb n="186" facs="tcp:204830:403"/> but his heires. O gallant ſervitude indeed! O Princely Maſter! Stay here a while beloved, do not overſlip this advantageous pauſe I ſhall beſeech you make ere you go on: Be it on this; <hi>That</hi> it <hi>proceedeth from the bounty of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Maſter we earthly creatures do worthily, and laudably ſerve him, and are faithful to his ſervice.</hi> What <hi>bounty</hi> elſe is this but his abundant grace, firſt to enable us to endeavour, next (if we fail of performance) to make the ſervice <hi>worthy</hi> though, and <hi>laudable</hi> to boot; by his acceptance of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, as if we had been able to perform our duty, when it is himſelf that doth the work, and yet affords the praiſe thereof to us, becauſe we did but ſet our hands to the burthen that he lifted up? And hence it is our willingneſſe is lookt upon by him as if it were a perfect will, our deſires as if they were performances; becauſe what we wiſh he wills, what we but deſire to do he perfects, and ſo eſteems us his <hi>faithfull people,</hi> becauſe he is as well our <hi>faithful</hi> ſervant, as our noble Maſter; (himſelf avoucheth this, <hi>I came not to be ſerved, but to ſerve;</hi>) and ſo looks upon his own worth, his own praiſe as though they were radicated in us unworthy creatures; and thus is pleaſed in us even while we are diſpleaſed with our ſelves, to ſee how little we do in earneſt of that all which he accepteth at our hands, as if it all had been by us well done. O convincing goodneſſe! But we muſt further find this prayer adapted to the other ſervice of the day. And in one onely verſe of the Epiſtle we ſhall ſee it done. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient to think any thing</hi> of <hi>our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> if not to think, much leſſe to do. What ſo patt as this unto the Prayer? And yet S. Paul reſts not here; he ſhewes Gods bounty ſtops not untill he brings his ſervants to the top of all preferment, as he did when he honoured ſimple men with the title of Apoſtolate, when he made them Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>ſalvation</hi> unto all the world. When could this be more aptly made the ſubject of the Epiſtle, then now that the Prayer ſo magnifies <hi>the bounty</hi> of Almighty God unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? Or when could the Goſpel better begin with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe it was to thoſe that ſee our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt with
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:204830:403"/> their own <hi>eyes,</hi> whom Princes had in vain deſired to ſee, and could not have the honour of that view; which yet he was ſo laviſh of unto his choſen <hi>ſervants,</hi> to his Apoſtles, Diſciples, and ſeveral devotes of both ſexes? And when could the double-dealing <hi>Doctour</hi> be better reprehended for his boaſted zeal of knowing how to gain eternal life, then in this Goſpel we do read he was, by being told, God was no way better ſerved then when men did mutually love each other, and ſhew this <hi>love</hi> to be ſincere by helping one another in their need? For then we <hi>ſerve God faithfully, worthily, and laudably,</hi> when we love our neighbour as our ſelves; then <hi>we run without offence unto the promiſes of Almighty God,</hi> when we do that which Jeſus told the <hi>Doctour of the Law</hi> he ſhould by doing ſecure himſelf of everlaſting life; that is, by loving one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.

Paul did not arrogate to himſelf that he was able to be a miniſter to his own, or any others ſalvation of himſelf, but attributes all this to the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of Almighty God. So Catholicks teach out of this place againſt hereticks, that our own free will is not able to will our own ſalvation as an act purely our own; but it muſt proceed from God that we will <hi>any thing</hi> in order to a ſupernaturall end, and ſuch is our ſalvation. Yet hence it follows not, that deſire of our ſalvation is not an act of our free will, but that free will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is not able or ſufficient thereunto without Gods grace, and ſpeciall aſſiſtance: ſo we allow two cauſes neceſſary to concurre unto humane ſalvation; grace, as the ſupernaturall, and our cooperation (thereby) with an act of freewill, as the naturall; this laſt being elevated, as it were, by the firſt to do more with it concurring, then it could have done alone.</p>

                           <p n="25">25. This <hi>Lawyer</hi> is therefore ſaid to <hi>tempt him,</hi> becauſe he did not ask with a ſincere deſire to know what to do for gaining heaven; but rather to entrap him, if he had ſaid any thing contrary to the Law of Moyſes, by venting or abetting a new doctrine of his own.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. See how in this verſe Chriſt fruſtrates the <hi>Lawyers</hi> plot, referring him to the <hi>written</hi> Law, contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours expectation.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. In this verſe is grounded the Catholick doctrine that the Law is obſerveable, againſt Hereticks who ſay it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be kept. Not that the <hi>love</hi> here commanded is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be extenſive, or intenſive, but onely comparative, final, and appretiative, that is, nothing ought by us to be loved better then God, more finally then God, nor more dearly, or appretiatively. By the <hi>heart, ſoul,</hi> and <hi>mind</hi> is here explicated the whole Will of man applyed to the <hi>love</hi> of God. By <hi>ſtrength</hi> is explicated here his endeavours, and forces uſed to ſhew this <hi>love</hi> in all his actions. By loving <hi>our neighbour as our ſelves,</hi> is not underſtood as well as our ſelves, for a man may lawfully love himſelf better then his neighbour, but yet ſo as withal he is bound to love his neighbour too; and ſelf-love is not ſo much commanded, as preſumed, becauſe it is natural, but the love of our neighbour is an abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, becauſe our neighbour is as dear to God as we, and was created by him as we are, redeemed by him as we are, and ſo muſt be beloved by us becauſe he is as well beloved of God as we, if not better, and if he be a better Chriſtian ſure enough he is better beloved.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. Here our Saviour caught the Doctour, who thought to have entrapped him, by telling him the keeping of this
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:204830:407"/> Law is the way to live everlaſtingly; but the Doctour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Chriſt would have contradicted the Law, and not have confirmed, or bound him to keep it; which therefore he did bind him to, becauſe it was a Law of <hi>love,</hi> not of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, as thoſe other lawes were which Chriſt abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. By <hi>justifying himſelf</hi> is here underſtood a huge pride in this Doctour, as who ſhould ſay, he was ſo juſt a keeper of the Law, and ſo juſt thereby, that he did not think he had his fellow in juſtice, or any <hi>neighbour</hi> like to himſelf; and ſo he demanded of Chriſt to know who was his <hi>neighbour,</hi> who ſo juſt as he, who to be compared with him.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. By theſe words <hi>Jeſus taking it,</hi> is intimated Jeſus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the latent pride of the man; and ſo in the following <hi>parable</hi> undertook to confound him, and make him anſwer himſelf, by finding that no man in miſery is to be rejected by thoſe who are in proſperity; but that the way to make a man in proſperity as good as another in miſery, is to commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerate his caſe, and to relieve his wants who is in need, not to neglect, or ſcorn him, as it ſeems the Lawyer did all others beſides himſelf, whileſt he thought no man ſo juſt as he was. True, by the word <hi>tempting,</hi> (as above) it is evident this was firſt the ſenſe of the Lawyer, till afterwards (as ſome ſay) he found by his converſation with our Saviour, that his own heart was changed from malicious to religious. If ſo, the ſenſe is ſound that ſayes really the Lawyer deſired to become <hi>juſt;</hi> and did not then (as formerly) think he was ſo, but with a real deſire of becoming ſo ask Chriſt <hi>who was his neighbour,</hi> that he might love him as he did himſelf. And this ſtands with reaſon, becauſe the Jewes held none for their <hi>neighbours</hi> but vertuous people of their own Nation, ſo they thought it a vertue to hate a ſinful Jew, or a Gentile; but our Saviour reduced them from this errour by the following <hi>parable,</hi> wherein he made the Jewiſh Lawyer ſee the Samaritan was the Jewes <hi>neighbour,</hi> if he did love him, and relieve him in his wants, and that Chriſtian perfection extended even to the love of enemies. Where note, that our Saviour takes
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:204830:407"/> hold of the dangerous paſſage that was between <hi>Jeruſalem and Jericho,</hi> becauſe none could paſſe almoſt without danger of being rob'd, ſtript, wounded, and many times ſlain. By this man <hi>half-ſlain</hi> is underſtood the ſtate of man corrupted by the fall of Adam, whoſe underſtanding, and free will remain, but ſo as a man half dead is ſaid to live in reſpect of another in full health, and vigour of body.</p>
                           <p n="31">31. 32. This is underſtood <hi>a chance</hi> to man, but a true providence in reſpect of God, who therefore ordained thoſe <hi>paſſengers</hi> ſhould <hi>go by,</hi> that ſome of them might relieve the wounded man. But by this act of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Levite,</hi> we are inſtructed how little inward vertue was in the Miniſters of the Church under the old Law, all their ſanctity conſiſting in outward ceremony, and having no acquaintance with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſincerity, <hi>or charity,</hi> ſo as diſdaining they went off from him whom they found in miſery, in the way they were to paſſe.</p>
                           <p n="33">33. By the <hi>Samaritan</hi> is here figured Chriſt the perfect Prieſt of the perfect new Law, and light of the Goſpel. He therefore goes not off, blancheth not from the man in miſery, but comes near him, and hath pity on him.</p>
                           <p n="34">34. By the <hi>oyl,</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> underſtand the Sacraments of the new Law made as ſalves to cure the ſore of ſin: which yet literally may be taken for the <hi>Samaritans</hi> proviſion in his journey. By his own <hi>beaſt</hi> may here be underſtood the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt, taking upon his back all our ſins to eaſe us of the burthen.</p>
                           <p n="35">35. By the <hi>two pence</hi> given the <hi>hoſte</hi> may be underſtood the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, conſiſting of two natures in Chriſt, Divine, and humane. The <hi>hoſte</hi> may ſignifie the Deacon, or the Prieſt of the new Law, or the Prieſt aſſiſting the Biſhop in adminiſtration of the holy Euchariſt. By what he ſhould <hi>ſupererogate</hi> is here underſtood what he ſhould ſpend in cure of this man above the <hi>two pence</hi> held ſufficient, he would repay: and here is grounded the Catholick doctrine of works of ſupererogation, which Hereticks allow not of. And by this <hi>Parable</hi> is inſinuated, that what the old Law had
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:204830:408"/> not power to do for recovery of the wounds in corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the new Law, by way of the Prieſts, and Sacraments thereof is ſufficient for, and ſo can ſave even all the corrupted ſeed of Adam by the virtue they have from the paſſion of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="36">36. Chriſt doth not intend to ask <hi>which of theſe was neighbour to the wounded man;</hi> for all men are truly neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours each to other; but onely which behaved himſelf like <hi>a neighbour.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="37">37. Here you ſee Chriſt by a queſtion makes the Doctour be his own inſtructer; commends his anſwer, and tells him, <hi>if he will be ſaved he muſt not onely know, but do the law of charity;</hi> and this whileſt he bids him do to all men as the <hi>Samaritan</hi> did to the Jew; to enemy as well as friend, to bad as well as good Chriſtians, if the bad one be in miſery. Thus Chriſt hath made curioſity the cauſe of ſincerity, and diſſimulation the cauſe of truth in this entrapping <hi>Lawyer;</hi> and no marvail, ſince he alone is able to cull good out of bad.</p>

THis dayes Epiſtle taught us a due regard to <hi>the Law</hi> of God, leaſt breaking it we looſe the hopes of heaven, and all the expectation of the happy <hi>promiſes</hi> God made to thoſe who keep his holy <hi>Law.</hi> This Goſpel tells us now how to keep that <hi>Law:</hi> By <hi>loving</hi> our neighbour as we love our ſelves: by loving him for that dear Jeſus ſake to whom he is probably much more dear then we, as happily offending God leſſe, however moſt diſpleaſing us, who are ſtill leſſe pleaſed with others, when we our ſelves do moſt diſpleaſe the heavenly Majeſty. So 'tis not indeed what others do to us that ought to trouble us, but our omitting that we ought to do to pleaſe Almighty God, and purchaſe heaven by keeping of his holy <hi>Lawes:</hi> which then our Saviour ſayes are kept, when we are <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> to our neighbours, for the <hi>love</hi> we bear to God: ſo the Goſpel ends; <hi>Do this and live:</hi> Live eternally, live in the happy fruition of all the vaſte

                              <hi>promiſes</hi> God made to thoſe that <hi>love</hi> him thus.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. But we have yet a better pattern of our duty then what Jeſus bid the <hi>Doctour of the Law</hi> take to ſecure him of this happineſſe, the charitable <hi>Samaritan.</hi> We have our deareſt Lord, our Bleſſed Saviour Jeſus here, not onely the giver, but the keeper of this his <hi>Law;</hi> leaſt we ſhould argue our impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to keep the ſame; when we ſee at how dear a rate he kept it, how he ſo <hi>loved</hi> us, as he laid his life down for a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his <hi>love,</hi> and gave us grace to do the like, as the onely means of doing it. Nor had the end (our glory) been otherwayes atchieveable, then by the meanes unto it, (his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grace:) ſo he that would our happy end, muſt will us the meanes to compaſſe it; this followes naturally, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the rule of grace undeniable, nature being ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by grace. Hear how he ſayes himſelf, <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes that ſee the things you ſee,</hi> &amp;c. and to the reſt of thoſe things (which the Explication enumerates) we may avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably here adde this for one, their <hi>ſeeing</hi> Jeſus give his life for an example to us, of valuing his <hi>love</hi> at as dear a rate as he did our <hi>loves</hi> when he dy'd to gain them.</p>

                           <p>HEere's a Prayer that in one word of it richly containes all the doctrine of this day, and indeed all the main point of the differential doctrine between the Roman Catholick
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:204830:409"/> Church, and her antagoniſts, eſpecially the Hereticks of this time; who deny good works to be neceſſary to mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will have no more then faith alone required on our parts, pretending, the work of our ſalvation is already finiſhed by the paſſion of our Lord, if we do but believe as much. It is otherwiſe with us: for here we pray not onely for other acts of virtue, namely, <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>charitie;</hi> but even for our own increaſe of <hi>faith,</hi> as well as for increaſe in other good works, which as they are all rooted in theſe three Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call virtues, ſo are they contained in them as the tree is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the root thereof, or rather in the ſeed that runs to root the better to ſupport the tree. That then we may pray as well to the bettering of our underſtandings, as to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting our wills in the ſervice of Almighty God, know, beloved, holy Church to day inſtructs us in this Prayer to beg <hi>increaſe</hi> of all good works, eminentially included in the three Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall virtues above mentioned; and doth further declare, that by this <hi>increaſe</hi> it is, <hi>we may deſerve to obtain as much as God Almightie hath pleaſed to promiſe us,</hi> (which is no leſſe then his heavenly glory) eſpecially if we can by our <hi>increaſe</hi> in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue arrive as well to <hi>love,</hi> as to do <hi>what God commands;</hi> that is to ſay in other termes, if we ſo <hi>love</hi> God, as for his ſake we can alſo <hi>love the things commanded</hi> though never ſo contrary to our liking; for then we Saint our ſelves indeed when thus we <hi>love.</hi> And why? becauſe where ſinne is not in man, ſanctitie will be undoubtedly; as it was in S. Marie Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene, who then was even canonized by our Lord himſelf when he declared, <hi>Many ſinnes were forgiven her becauſe ſhe loved much,</hi> Luke 7.47. And by <hi>many</hi> we underſtand <hi>all,</hi> for God never doth his works to halſes but leaves them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perfectly compleat. And having thus evinced the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of this gloſſe out of the letter of the Prayer, let us further ſee how the Canon of the Churches ſervice is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, by the muſicke of her Prayer to day, which is therefore beſt becauſe it is throughout three parts in one. Nay, if I ſaid the whole Epiſtle, Goſpel, and the Prayer to boot were all contained in the word <hi>increaſe,</hi> perhaps I ſhould not
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:204830:410"/> erre; for if we but apply that word unto the things wherein we beg <hi>increaſe,</hi> the work is done, the cabinet of rich connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by that key is open to the view of the world. But leſt ſome dimmer ſighted ſouls do not perceive as much, it will not be amiſſe to ſhow the whole Epiſtle of the day doth run upon the ground-work of the Prayer, while from the firſt unto the laſt, it beats upon the <hi>faith</hi> of Abraham, joyned with the <hi>hope</hi> of a reward for his obedience, performed with an act of <hi>charitie,</hi> wherewith he ſhewed he did deſerve the <hi>promiſe</hi> of Almighty God becauſe <hi>he loved his commandement</hi> better then he did his onely ſonne <hi>Iſaack,</hi> whom he was ready to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to ſhow how truely <hi>he did love the ſaid command.</hi> Compare this now unto the Prayer, and ſee what can be more deſired to make the harmony compleat. Yet further look upon the Fathers expoſitions of the laſt verſe in this Epiſtle as you ſee below, and then ſay if the gloſſe I made above be other then Expoſitours allow. As for the Goſpell, tis alike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording with the Prayer, if we believe the Fathers of the Church expound the <hi>ſaving faith</hi> aright, wherewith it ends, when they declare, this <hi>faith</hi> was <hi>ſaving</hi> to the cured <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> becauſe it was accompanied with his good works, namely, with his <hi>hope</hi> of cure; when in that <hi>hope</hi> he paid <hi>obedience</hi> unto Chriſt ſaying, <hi>go ſhew your ſelves unto the Prieſt,</hi> for the Text ſayes after, <hi>and it came to paſſe as they went they were made clean;</hi> and laſtly, by his <hi>gratitude,</hi> returning to give thanks for the cure: which acts of other virtues, <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>gratitude</hi> made manifeſt his <hi>charitie,</hi> ſince they were good works growing out of that root; and ſince by this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>gratitude</hi> we ſee the <hi>Samaritan</hi> ſhewed an <hi>increaſe</hi> of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> in him, upon his ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion wrought together with his corporall cure, the Church with all the reaſon in the world prayes to day for <hi>increaſe</hi> of the like virtues, and thus adapts the <hi>Prayer</hi> unto the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of this dayes ſervice ſo exactly well, as we may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay the ſpirit of the Epiſtle, and Goſpel is as it were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentially contained in the Prayer above.</p>

                           <p n="16">16. IN recompenſe of his faith were theſe <hi>promiſes made to Abraham,</hi> which are read Gen. 22. &amp;c. Nay even of Iſaac himſelf, whom his Father Abraham obediently ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, would Chriſt deſcend, that ſo <hi>in Abrahams ſeed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> might be made good. Yet this <hi>ſeed</hi> is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Iſaac, but Chriſt of Abraham by Iſaac lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending. Note, theſe <hi>promiſes</hi> were not made ſo to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> as to fall upon his perſon, but upon the perſon of his ſeed, Chriſt Jeſus; for in him indeed were all the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> truly performed which were <hi>made to Abraham,</hi> ſince by believing in Chriſt we are all ſaved, not by any merits of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi> So <hi>Abrahams ſeed</hi> or poſteritie is not here taken collectively, as importing <hi>many,</hi> but as importing one onely branch of the ſaid poſterity, namely, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. Since it was ſaid before v. 15. mans will, and teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not to be broken, much leſſe that <hi>Teſtament which is confirmed by God himſelf,</hi> which were theſe promiſes to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham; no, they are not violable by any Law, leſſe by a Law ſubſequent thereunto, as by the Law of Moſes which was 430 years after theſe <hi>promiſes</hi> to Abraham.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. Hence it is evident, <hi>Abrahams ſeed</hi> did not <hi>inherit theſe benedictions</hi> by virtue of <hi>the Law,</hi> which was delivered to Moyſes on the mount Sinai 430 years after God had made <hi>the promiſe</hi> of theſe <hi>benedictions,</hi> as if that <hi>Law</hi> were giving life, or ſaving ſouls; but by virtue of the <hi>promiſe</hi> made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law of Moyſes was written. So that our ſalvation flowes out of the faith we have in Chriſt to whom the <hi>promiſes</hi> were made that by his perſon, <hi>being the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> all men ſhould be made happy. For this <hi>promiſe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves the faith of Chriſt as the means to ſave us, ſo doth not the <hi>Law</hi> of Moyſes, rehearſing onely the ſaid <hi>promiſe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="19">19. This queſtion is of difficulty, the premiſes in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent verſes conſidered: yet it is evident <hi>the Law</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned was not ſaving, but rather to terrifie the <hi>tranſgreſſours,</hi>
                              <pb n="203" facs="tcp:204830:411"/> and to declare their tranſgreſſions, then to ſave them; for neither was there time yet or place for a ſaving <hi>Law,</hi> ſince the Saviour of the world was not come; ſo this was at moſt but a middle <hi>Law</hi> between that of nature before it, and this of grace following of it, which we now enjoy, and ſo it was adapted as to a middle uſe, to civilize rather then to ſave men, who even in the time of this <hi>law</hi> were not ſavd by virtue of it, but by virtue of <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hope</hi> in Chriſt who was to come after this <hi>law,</hi> and who was prefigured by it. So S. Paul ſpeaks plainly when he ſayes in this verſ, <hi>this law was made but for tranſgreſſors untill the ſeed of promiſe,</hi> that is, untill Chriſt ſhould come. In the following words, <hi>ordained by Angels,</hi> is inſinuated the Catholick Doctrine, telling us this <hi>Law</hi> was written<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Angels,</hi> or Gods Embaſſadours, not by God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and ſo like Embaſſadours they uſe his name, and ſpeak in his perſon whom they perſonate, that is in Gods Name; whence it is, that part of this <hi>Law</hi> which was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Jeſus Chriſt, comes elevated or dignified unto us by the dignitie of the deliverer, the Sonne of God himſelf, not onely an Angel. By <hi>the hand of a Mediatour</hi> is underſtood the perſon of him that did then <hi>mediate</hi> between God, and the People of Iſrael, namely Moyſes, into whoſe <hi>hand</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> was given. For ſince a <hi>Mediatour</hi> muſt be a party placed between two, and partaking of both ſides, here <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour</hi> muſt not be underſtood of Chriſt, who was not then in being as man, but onely his Deitie had being, his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie had it not. Nor is Chriſt called <hi>our mediatour</hi> as God onely, but as God, and man: for as God he partakes of the dignitie, and authoritie of his <hi>Mediatourſhip;</hi> as Man he exerciſeth the works, and merits of a <hi>Mediatour.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Angel is ſaid here, to uſe the <hi>hand of the Mediatour</hi> to deliver the <hi>Law</hi> by, but that was <hi>Moyſes hand,</hi> ſo in this place he muſt be underſtood to be the <hi>Mediatour.</hi>

                           <p n="20">20. This verſe again confirms what was ſaid in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that Moyſes is ſpoken of for <hi>Mediatour,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from God, whileſt the Apoſtle ſayes, a <hi>Mediatour is not of one;</hi> ſo Moyſes was not of one ſide onely, but of Gods, and the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:204830:412"/> Jews, or rather Gods choſen people the children of Iſrael. So <hi>Mediatour</hi> is not taken here for Chriſt as mediating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God, and Chriſtians, or all Nations, but as Moyſes <hi>mediating</hi> between God, and the Jews onely, a particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for this <hi>mediation</hi> was not to ſalvation, ſince that was Chriſts, and could be none others, becauſe he could both plead as man, and forgive as God. This is yet cleared more by the following words, ſaying, <hi>God is one,</hi> and ſo could not be the <hi>Mediatour</hi> here mentioned which was Moyſes, for <hi>God</hi> had not then put on humane nature to render him of a double conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, or concern, but onely was one creating, not <hi>media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> God which muſt be man too. So that the true ſenſe of this place is, <hi>God, who is one,</hi> then made Moyſes <hi>Mediatour</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, and the Jews, and ſince made Chriſt <hi>Mediatour</hi> between him, and all the Nations of the world. Wherefore that <hi>law</hi> of Moyſes was rather an uſher to Chriſt his <hi>law,</hi> then a fulfiller of the <hi>promiſes made to Abraham,</hi> for they were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled by Chriſt, and his holy Goſpel, being the means as well to ſave, as to govern men; whereas Moyſes his law could onely govern them, but their ſalvation had root in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing law of Chriſt, who had power as God to abrogate what he pleaſed of Moyſes law, and to confirm what he pleaſed thereof, and to make what new law beſt liked himſelf, as he did when he made our ſaving law of the Goſpel. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, theſe words, <hi>God is one,</hi> import the Saviour of the Jews was not Moyſes, but even that one God who alſo ſaveth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations; and therefore he is emphatically called here <hi>one God,</hi> that is to ſay one Saviour.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. This verſe onely reduplicates the former ſenſes, and ſayes that neither the <hi>law</hi> of Moyſes was againſt the <hi>promiſes of God made to</hi> Abraham, nor yet was it that <hi>law</hi> which did, or could <hi>justifie</hi> the people, but that it was as it were a ſtay or prop (a pedagogue indeed as follows v. 24. of this chapter) unto them to keep them in aw, and order untill Chriſt came, in whom <hi>the promiſes made to Abraham</hi> were to be performed, and he coming the pedagogue of Moſes <hi>law</hi> was to ceaſe at his pleaſure.</p>

                              <pb n="205" facs="tcp:204830:412"/>22. By <hi>the Scripture concluding all things under ſin,</hi> is here underſtood Moyſes his written law, which then was, and ſtill is called the <hi>Scripture</hi> even to this day: yet by this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding</hi> is not underſtood the <hi>Scripture orders ſinne to be,</hi> but onely, that (<hi>this Scripture</hi> notwithſtanding) all men then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lay under the yoke of ſinne, and were not by virtue of that <hi>Scripture</hi> freed from this yoke, but by Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe perſon (and not in Moyſes law) did conſiſt our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, promiſed to <hi>Abrahams ſeed,</hi> that was to Chriſt Jeſus. Note here, the <hi>promiſes ſaid to be given to thoſe that believe,</hi> do not exempt from good works, nor make faith alone (even in Jeſus Chriſt) without works to be ſaving; but ſuch a faith onely ſaves which works by charity.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THe ſcope of this Epiſtle is, to tell us with how ample a reward Almighty God did recompence the obedience of Abraham, in being ready to ſacrifice his onely ſonne Iſaac according as he was commanded by the Authour of life: Namely, with ſuch a bleſſing upon his ſeed, as ſhould bring a benediction upon the whole ſeed of Adam, all mankind: So that ſince the firſt root of all mans miſery was Adams diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in a triviall thing, an apple, therefore God was pleaſed to take an occaſion of making Abrahams obedience in a weighty thing the apple of his eye, his onely Joy, the riſe of all mans happineſſe; not that Abrahams obedience, did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie God for Adams diſobedience, but that the ſonne of God who was to ſatisfie the Divine Juſtice for this ſinne, did pleaſe to take that firſt mans fleſh upon him, who firſt by his obedience taught man the way to keep the law of God, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his commands.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. And certainly it was with deep deſigne Almighty God delayed his <hi>promiſe</hi> unto Abraham four hundred and thirty years before he was pleaſed to make a beginning of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in giving by Moyſes a Law to lawleſſe man; and by that Law to try the children of Abraham the Jews, before he
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:204830:413"/> gave a better Law to them, and all the world beſides, by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. The deſign we may both piouſly and profitably preſume was as well to prove the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> of Abraham, as his <hi>obedience</hi> and his <hi>love</hi> were proved in the ſacrificing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Iſaac.</hi> For probably there paſſed not one minute of time over Abrahams head, nor over the heads of his poſterity, wherein they did not give themſelves an infinite content in thinking on the goodneſſe, and on the veracity of God, that ſurely he would not fail to verifie his <hi>promiſes</hi> which he had graciouſly made unto them: the frequent memory we find in holy Writ, and the gladſomeneſſe wherewith the mention is made of theſe <hi>promiſes</hi> teſtifie as much; and conſequently prove Abrahams whole life time was in a manner one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>act of faith,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> in the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. O beloved! how can we read this Text, and not be animated to an imitation of like acts of virtue, of like <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to ſo ſweet a <hi>Law</hi> as we enjoy, when all the end thereof is felicity without an end! Or if we cannot think our ſelves ſo much concerned as Abraham, who had as vve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of having concurr'd to the ſalvation of all mankind, as of himſelf; at leaſt let us not come ſhort of Abrahams po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, of the Jews; ſee how they boaſt here, how they vaunt themſelves thence the ſole people of Almighty God, becauſe they were deſcended but from Abraham: When did the ceaſe to glory in the <hi>promiſes</hi> made of Jeſus but to come; and that (as they thought) to make them onely rich, onely honourable here on earth, onely temporally happy? whereas we Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans know he is actually come, hath left us rich here in grace, and made us ſure of heavenly honour, of eternall felicity, and of greater riches yet in glory, if we be not defective to our ſelves. O how ſhould our whole lives be <hi>one act of faith, one act of hope, one act of charity,</hi> one continuall indeavour to prove all this, by a perpetuall <hi>obedience</hi> to the Law of Chriſt, from whom we are extracted in a righter line then the Jews yet were deſcended from Abraham, ſince their naturall conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption was in ſinne our ſupernaturall <hi>adoption</hi> is in grace!</p>

HE was then going from Ceſarea to Jeruſalem, to the feaſt of the Tabernacles, and was willing to paſſe by <hi>Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Galilee:</hi> (the right way indeed he was to go, yet) he went that way with ſpeciall zeal to requite the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie he received in being caſt out of a village in that countrey, and ill uſed after a cure he did upon one of that countrey men, a Samaritan; ſhewing us by this, an example to requite evil turns with good offices.</p>

                           <p n="13">13. They muſt ſpeak aloud to be heard at a diſtance. By the word <hi>voice</hi> underſtand their common, and unanimous conſent to beg cure of Chriſt: And note, they call him here rather <hi>Maſter,</hi> then Doctour, to argue they ſought not ſo much his doctrine, as his power, for in that they confided what ere they thought of the other; they took him to be as powerfull almoſt as God, and ſo beſought him to command away their <hi>leproſie</hi> by his power, and by his command to ſhew his <hi>mercy</hi> to them.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. <hi>Whom as he ſaw,</hi> This ſhows Gods promptitude to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:204830:414"/> do us good as ſoon as he but ſees our neceſſities: he bid them <hi>go ſhow themſelves to the Prieſts,</hi> becauſe no cured <hi>leper</hi> could be reſtored to the ſociety of other men unleſſe he had the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Prieſts to declare that he was cured; ſo though Chriſt ſent them <hi>to the Prieſts</hi> for this cauſe to obſerve the Law as Levit. 24. was preſcribed, yet withall he did it to let the Prieſts ſee the miracle was done by him, becauſe they were cured before they came at the Prieſts, even indeed as ſoon as they obeyed his voice, ſaying, <hi>go ſhow your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Now myſtically they were bid <hi>go</hi> to the Prieſts, to declare that in the new law there is no cure from the leproſie of ſinne, but by confeſſing it to the Prieſts; and though contrition be never ſo great, able to ſave without confeſſion, yet by this place we ground that there muſt be at leaſt a deſire, or an indeavour to confeſſe if it be poſſible.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. That of ten there went but <hi>one</hi> back to give Chriſt thanks, argues the generality of men to be ingratefull unto God, though he be never ſo beneficiall to them.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. That this <hi>one</hi> came in ſo humble a manner, as <hi>to fall at Chriſt his feet, being a Samaritan,</hi> and ſo abhorring all Jews, made the miracle the greater; when thereby it appeared how much the grace of God ſhined in this man, who by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Samaritan, hating Jeſus that was a Jew, yet by obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion became his captive, and laid himſelf at his feet. Again, it argues the converſion of Gentiles is more perfect then that of Jews, ſince nine Jewiſh <hi>lepers</hi> ſhewed no gratitude to Chriſt their own countrey-man, whilſt a mere ſtranger, a Samaritan expreſſed a moſt gratefull heart for the favour of his corporall cure, and of his myſticall converſion.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. This verſe argues Chriſt was ſenſible of the Jewiſh ingratitude, which act of theirs made the gratitude of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> more pleaſing to him, and more remarkable to the world; but theſe that came not back declared they were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with ſelf-intereſt, at the joy they had to be reſtored to the commerce of men, and ſo neglected their religious repair to God.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. It had indeed been a <hi>glory to God</hi> to give thanks to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:204830:415"/> Chriſt who was God, and man: and as it was <hi>Gods</hi> miracle wrought by Chriſt, ſo the <hi>glory</hi> was due to <hi>God,</hi> and not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated by Chriſt to himſelf; whoſe wonder was not that they forbore to give him thanks, but that they neglected to <hi>glorifie God</hi> by returning to him, as the <hi>forreiner,</hi> the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> did.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. Jeſus did not ſay unto him, <hi>ariſe, and go</hi> hence out of the company of the Jews being a <hi>Samaritan;</hi> but <hi>go</hi> and be, for thy gratitude to me, gratefull unto my people, converſe with them as a native; (<hi>forreiner</hi> though thou art) to ſhow that union of <hi>faith</hi> makes amitie amongſt all Nations, for by admitting him into the company of the Jews he declared his <hi>faith,</hi> and theirs were one.

So by this account all Sundayes, &amp; Holy dayes require an exerciſe of theſe three virtues Theologicall: and conſequently all the time of private prayer is to be ſpent in actual exerciſe of theſe, becauſe that prayer is an addreſſe to God; as all the time of perſecution, that being ſuffered for Gods ſake; all the time of troubles, for thoſe are cauſed by ſinne againſt Almighty God, and muſt have end by ſaintitie; ſo by this account all our life time muſt be a practice of theſe virtues, an <hi>increaſe</hi> of them indeed, as the onely means to make us ſaints, to make us capable of God Almighties <hi>promiſes</hi> by loving theſe his eaſie, his ſweet, his ſaving commandements, which are the continual exerciſe of theſe Theologicall virtues

                           <p>HOw excellently well is the much of the Epiſtle, and Goſpel contained in the little of this Prayer! wherein we confeſſe it is by the <hi>perpetuall propitiation</hi> of our Saviours paſſion, <hi>(without which our humane mortality would be alwaies failing)</hi> as the <hi>onely help</hi> conducing to ſupport us, that <hi>we can be withdrawn</hi> from the works of the fleſh, and directed to walk in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>taken off from thoſe things which are hurtfull, and directed to thoſe that are ſaving.</hi> And what elſe is the whole Epiſtle but an exhortation <hi>to leave off the works of the fleſh, and to purſue the fruits of the Spirit?</hi> Again, what are <hi>the two maſters</hi> which the Goſpel ſaies <hi>we cannot ſerve at once,</hi> but the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit?</hi> what the drift of all the Goſpel, but to dehort from one, and exhort unto the other? So here <hi>Epistle, Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> ſpeak all one thing, how ſeverall ſoever the language be of each: and no marvell, becauſe the ſpirit of Almighty God is able to animate all the creatures of the world; Act. 17.28. <hi>For it is he in whom we live, are moved, and have being.</hi> Now having thus made good our main affair of this work, (the mutuall connexion of parts in holy Churches ſervice) it reſts onely to elucidate a word or two in the Prayer above, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame (in it ſelf) perfectly underſtood. The firſt is, the <hi>perpetuall propitiation</hi> wherewith we beg <hi>the Church</hi> may be <hi>kept;</hi> for though above we called that <hi>propitiation</hi> an effect of our Saviors paſſion, yet here we muſt further give a reaſon why we did ſo call it, and alſo why we in the Prayer affirm the ſame to be a <hi>perpetuall</hi> effect thereof. Know therefore, it is the effect of his paſſion, becauſe it is not onely a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for ſinne, but alſo a pacification of Gods wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:204830:417"/> mankind, who by ſinne had provoked Almightie God to a high indignation againſt the whole race of men: And therefore we call this <hi>propitiation perpetuall,</hi> becauſe it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in duration, as well as in power of appeaſing; for though it be now above 1651. years ſince our Saviour did actually ſuffer, yet the virtue of his ſuffering is ſtill vigorous, and ſhall be to the worlds end, becauſe it was the ſuffering of God as well as of man, and therefore muſt needs have an eternall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, that is, be able for all eternity to appeaſe the wrath divine: and in this ſenſe we ſay the preſervation of the world in being, is the continuation of the act whereby it was created, ſo the preſervation of mens ſouls from the wrath of the heavenly Father, is the continuation of the paſſion of his ſacred Sonne. The next phraſe of this Prayer which we are to clear is that, wherein we ſay <hi>without our perpetually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious Lord Humane mortalitie would fail;</hi> as if there were any other <hi>mortalitie</hi> then <hi>humane</hi> that were capable of the benefit of our Saviours paſſion, of his <hi>perpetuall propitiation.</hi> Truely no, there is not; for ſince it was onely Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that he aſſumed, (and by aſſuming it was pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the ſame) we ſay rightly well no other <hi>mortalitie</hi> was capable of the benefit of this redemption; not but that other natures are mortall, as all terreſtriall creatures are in the very rigour of death, or <hi>mortalitie,</hi> becauſe they all die by way of corruption; and if we ſay the celeſtiall ſpirits are mortall too becauſe they may be held to die when they fell from heaven to hell, from the ſtate of grace, to the ſtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, we ſhall not ſpeak improperly: and truly the phraſe of this Prayer ſeems to allude to that <hi>mortality</hi> of the bleſſed ſpirits, when therein we are taught to affirm, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours paſſion was a <hi>propitiation</hi> peculiarly provided for the ſubſiſtence onely of <hi>humane mortalitie,</hi> ſince it was a remedy provided onely to recover (ſo often as they chance to fall) <hi>mortall men,</hi> and not any other <hi>mortall</hi> creature beſides, either terreſtriall, or celeſtiall: And thus the ſtile <hi>of humane mortalitie</hi> is moſt appoſite, becauſe man onely had the happineſſe of mercy to be ſhewed him for his ſins, which was a favour never
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:204830:417"/> done to any Angel whatſoever; and this mercy is juſt the ſame which this preſent Prayer avoucheth, begging that <hi>our humane mortalitie</hi> (which needs muſt fail without it) <hi>may have the benefit of our bleſſed Saviours perpetuall propitiation</hi> by the application thereunto of his bitter death, and paſſion, which will afford it <hi>helps</hi> to avoid what is <hi>hurtfull,</hi> and to follow what is <hi>ſaving.</hi>

And the firſt of theſe is

                           <p n="24">24. BY <hi>ſerving</hi> is here underſtood loving, and obeying out of love, not <hi>ſerving</hi> for hire, ſince ſo we may <hi>ſerve</hi> many <hi>maſters.</hi> By <hi>can</hi> is meant <hi>can eaſily:</hi> So the text intimates onely a huge difficulty, not an abſolute impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. That this is the ſenſe the following words prove of <hi>hate,</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> Now the next words of <hi>ſustaining</hi> at leaſt argue a poſſibility, (though with difficulty) for to <hi>ſuſtain</hi> or bear argues a power thereof. The laſt words of this verſe, <hi>you cannot ſerve God, and Mammon,</hi> are taken ſtrictly for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and obeying; ſo thus the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>God and riches</hi> are incompatible <hi>maſters.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="25">25. By <hi>careful</hi> is here underſtood anxious, or ſolicitous: <hi>for your life</hi> is underſtood your ſoul, becauſe by that we live: and we are not to be anxious for our ſoules ſake what we <hi>eat,</hi> becauſe it doth not eat to keep it ſelf alive, but onely the body. The like anxiety is forbidden even for the body too, how it ſhall be attired. The following words are Chriſt his argument from the leſſe to the greater; as who ſhould ſay, I who have created your ſouls out of nothing will not fail to give you <hi>meat</hi> to conſerve them and the body in union, and health; which is to ſhew us, we ſhall not want his leſſe favour that have had his greater; ſo if he give our bodies life, and health, it is not likely he will deny us clothing for our bodies, unleſſe we fall to be anxiouſly ſolicitous how to clothe our ſelves, which anxiety is here forbidden, and we are counſelled to rely upon Gods providence herein.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. The ſame naturall argument flows in all the ſix fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes: But it is here worthy obſervation that Chriſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtances in birds then beaſts, to ſhew us, that as they live in the air, off from the earth for moſt part, ſo man ſhould have his thoughts in heaven and not in earth, and ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his food rather from heavenly providence then from earthly ſolicitude.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. And as ſuch ſolicitude were vain, ſo is it to care what
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:204830:422"/> we eat, or how long we protract our lives by curioſity of diet. And this example of a <hi>cubit</hi> is not improperly brought in, to ſhew us, that as the due proportion of a man is to be as ſquare or broad, (when his arms are ſtretched out) as he is long from head to foot; ſo a ſoul well proportioned muſt be ſolid in virtue, and conſtant in the purſuit thereof.</p>
                           <p n="28">28, 29. As the former verſes argued to caſt off care of meats, ſo theſe two next argue in like manner againſt anxiety in clothing; exemplyfying in the delicate attire of <hi>Lillies,</hi> and of Solomon who by art (the ape of nature) had made his attire to be decked with Lillies of moſt curious needlework, to ſhew the robes of grace, or nuptiall garments of our ſouls ſhould be as fragrant, and as pure in Gods ſight as Lillies are in ours; and if they be but ſo it imports not how our bodies are attired.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. By adding the low ſimilitude of the <hi>graſſes</hi> beauty after that high, and rich one of the <hi>Lillie,</hi> and Solomons garments, Chriſt augments the reaſon we have to confide in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards the meaneſt of perſons, ſince he is not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to adorn the <hi>graſſe</hi> as he doth. By <hi>graſſe</hi> is here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all plants, at leaſt ſuch as make fuell for <hi>ovens,</hi> for elſe in vain had he ſpoken of putting <hi>graſſe</hi> into the <hi>oven,</hi> if it had not been that after theſe fine green plants of the field were cut down, and loſt the ſplendour of their growing ſtate, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved now for nothing but fuell to fire, he had not intended to ſhew us that if God were ſo carefull for ſo ſmall a thing as <hi>graſse,</hi> and little green plants growing, to adorn them, as he doth; he would be much more carefull to cloth us with attire ſufficient for this life, whom he intends to inveſt in robes of glory for all eternity. By the cloſe of this verſe rebuking our very <hi>ſmall faith,</hi> is not underſtood our want of belief in God, but our want of truſt, or confidence rather, that he whom we believe to be ſo infinitely great, and good, can, and will have care of our leaſt neceſſities.</p>
                           <p n="31">31. He well ſubſumes to cloſe his argument, that after all theſe examples of his ſolicitude for the meaneſt creatures, he will not be careleſſe of us if we confide in him as we
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:204830:423"/> ought to do, for our due ſupplies both in <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>clothing.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="32">32. This is an excellent argument againſt the anxiety above, that it is common to <hi>heathens;</hi> and therefore no way proper to Chriſtians, who ſince they know God ſees their wants, they ought to referre the ſupply thereof to his omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as God, to his love as father, to his power as King of heaven and earth; ſo if he ſee, and ſupply not, he is pleaſed we ſhall ſuffer want, and therefore in vain we ſeek to have that elſe where which God pleaſeth to abridge us of: rather in this caſe we muſt be content as the <hi>graſse</hi> to loſe our luſtre, then covet to enjoy it when it is deſigned for feuell to the fire; ſo we muſt live rather content to die poor, then ſeek to live rich after God will have us die beggars. Note, it is onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of care, or anxious ſolicitude that we are forbidden, not ordinary diligence in our occaſions.</p>
                           <p n="33">33. By <hi>first</hi> is here underſtood chiefly, or principally; ſo that we are allowed a ſecondary care of our temporals, though our main imploy and ſtudy muſt be to get heaven, for that is the Kingdome of God. By Gods <hi>justice</hi> is here underſtood thoſe virtues, and good deeds that render us juſt in the ſight of God, and ſo capable of that heaven we are in the firſt place to ſeek, ſince it was the end for which we were firſt created. By <hi>thoſe things</hi> which ſhall be given us beſides are underſtood <hi>things</hi> of leſſe moment, and conſequently which ought to take up leſſe of our care, ſuch as are meat, clothes, and other temporalls.</p>

                           <p>WE heard in the expoſition of the laſt Sundayes prayer, that <hi>the perpetuall propitiation</hi> (there begged) was the continuation of our Saviours paſſion to be our continuall help in all occaſions; and now that to day we beg to have <hi>the mercy of our Lord continued to his Church,</hi> we ſeem but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the ſame prayer again in a varied phraſe. But if we caſt our eyes upon the Epiſtle, and Goſpel here below, and obſerve how the Expoſitours upon them apply the ſame, as declaring
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:204830:424"/> all the office of Prieſtly function, and telling us what ſhould be the duty of the people thereupon, we ſhall ſoon perceive as well a difference in the ſubſtance, as in the phraſe, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of theſe two prayers: That alluding to the immediate influence of the paſſion into us, by the perſonall help which our Saviour affords in the grace he gives us to repent us of our ſinnes; which relating to himſelf is fitly called his <hi>perpetuall propitiation,</hi> but reporting to the mediate helps we have from our Saviour by the mediation of his Miniſters, the Doctours, Teachers, Preachers, and Prieſts of holy Church, it is rather ſtiled <hi>his continued mercy</hi> towards us; becauſe it was his <hi>mercy</hi> that moved him to ſupply his own perſonall preſence amongſt us by the mediation of the Prieſts, whom in his place he left (by means of catechiſing, preaching, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments) to <hi>continue his mercy</hi> towards us, and by the <hi>continuation</hi> thereof <hi>to cleanſe, and defend</hi> his holy Church; <hi>cleanſed</hi> indeed by participation of the Sacraments, <hi>defended</hi> by the communication of the Prieſts their functions, ſacrifices, and prayers in her behalf; and yet our holy mother cloſeth up this Sundayes prayer with an immediate addreſſe again unto the fountain it ſelf, when ſhe concludes affirming, <hi>it is as well his bounty, as his mercy</hi> that ſhe ſubſiſteth by, when ſhe profeſſeth <hi>ſhe cannot ſtand ſecurely unleſſe ſhe be alwayes governed by his bounty,</hi> that is to ſay, by his holy grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto us through the hands of his Miniſters the Prieſts of holy Church: ſo that this prayer inſtructs us whence our helps do flow, and by what hands they are conveyed to us. And requiſite it is that we do pray in this ſort to day, when the Epiſtle runs all upon the Prieſts office to the people, and their putting in practice the Chriſtian doctrine taught them by the Prieſt; all which is neatly couched under the <hi>spirituality,</hi> wherewith the Epiſtle tells us both are rendred compleat, as ſignifying, neither the Maſter, nor the Schollar muſt ſow fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeds, ſince both muſt live by <hi>ſpirituall fruits.</hi> And for the Goſpel we hear the Fathers of the Church avouch it to be a <hi>parable</hi> alluding to the death of ſinne, and life of grace, which is coincident with what the Epiſtle taught us of <hi>ſowing spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:204830:425"/> ſeeds,</hi> that might bring forth <hi>fruits of grace,</hi> of Chriſt, not fleſhly, which produce nothing at all but <hi>corruption and death.</hi> Since then we have this prayer adjuſted to the ſenſe of the Expoſitours upon the other parts of this dayes ſervice, we make good our deſigne, as hitherto we did in ſome one of the latitudes, in the preface of this work, allowable unto this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Theologie.</p>

                           <p n="26">26. IF we have internall life of grace, and juſtice, let us <hi>walk</hi> juſtly according to the conduct of that grace, and by no means look back to the wayes of Judaiſme, being (as we are) Chriſtians; but let us ſo farre decline from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>vain-glorious,</hi> (as the Jews were) that we even for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the deſire as well as the act thereof; much leſſe let us vaunt our ſelves to be better then others, <hi>provoking</hi> them thereby to anger, or <hi>envying,</hi> if in any gift they excell us.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Note, S. Paul means here ſuch <hi>faults</hi> as are caſually (and by frailty) committed, not thoſe that are habituall, or accuſtomary; beſides, he glanceth here ſpecially at frail re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes to Judaiſme; and ſuch he commands the Galatians to <hi>inſtruct,</hi> that is, to reprehend gently, and with <hi>lenitie,</hi> not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly, or ſeverely as obſtinate offenders ought to be reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo beſides, he makes not every one a reprehender of his brethren, but thoſe onely that are <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> meaning Prieſts, or Churchmen; and ſuch reprehenſion he will have to be in <hi>spirit</hi> alſo, not in any vain way. Note, he falls from the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to the ſingular number, left he had elſe ſeemed to accuſe a whole community of frailty, and of danger to be tempted; which is indeed incident to ſingle perſons, and not handſomely imputed to many.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Here he comes to the plurall number again, exhorting
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:204830:426"/> us to <hi>bear each others burthens,</hi> whether they be of naturall diſpoſition, (not agreeing with our own) or whether they be diſeaſes, or afflictions laid upon our neighbour, or laſtly, and chiefly, even their ſinnes we muſt bear, indeed pardon, conceal, excuſe, and (if we wil perfectly obey this counſell) even do penance for them by our prayers, faſtings, or alms; and in ſo doing we ſhall <hi>fulfill the Law of Chriſt,</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of loving one another; <hi>This is my precept, that you love one another as I have loved you:</hi> Joh. 15.12. but he ſo loved us as he <hi>bore</hi> all our ſinnes upon his back, and therefore we muſt be content to help <hi>bear</hi> thoſe of our neighbours, to imitate the example of our Maſter.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. By <hi>ſomething</hi> is here underſtood, good, virtuous, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; as who ſhould ſay, if any man doth not follow the precept above of <hi>bearing his brothers burthen,</hi> let him never think he is, or can be <hi>any thing</hi> in the ſight of God. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the text is ſo far from eſteeming him for <hi>ſome body</hi> who is not ſweet, and gentle to his brother, as he is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſo much as <hi>any thing</hi> in the ſight of God, but is truly as nothing in his eye, and abſolutely ſeduceth, or cheateth <hi>himſelf</hi> if he conceiveth otherwiſe.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. In this verſe we are exhorted to valew our ſelves onely as we can deſerve to be eſteemed by Almighty God, where we all know we merit little, or nothing, and not as we may ſeem to be compared to others. For what availes it a man to ſee another commit greater ſins then himſelf, if he commit ſinne enough to damne him, or at leaſt to render him ungrateful to Almighty God? And yet nothing more common then for us to flatter our ſelves that all is well at home, if we ſee any greater evil in others then in our ſelves. To ſeek our glory out of others ignominy is folly: We ſhall never arrive to <hi>eternal glory</hi> in the next world, if we do not contrive to be ſuch here within our ſelves as may deſerve the reward of <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory,</hi> rather for our own good works, then becauſe others have greater bad ones to anſwer for then we.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Note, in the ſecond verſe above, the Apoſtle meant <hi>the burthens</hi> of the living brethren; in this, he reports to thoſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:204830:426"/> of the dead: and in that ſenſe we ſhould each one <hi>carry his own burthen</hi> before the Tribunal of Chriſt at the later day, as if our ſins were then laid in a knapſack, on our own backs, and each man there to anſwer onely for his own, unleſſe he had made himſelf alſo guilty of others ſins too, and in ſuch caſe they become his alſo. The Reformers miſ-underſtand this place when they alleadge it againſt <hi>purgatory,</hi> and will therefore have it needleſſe to eaſe our brethren in <hi>purgatory</hi> of their <hi>burthens</hi> by our prayers. Alas! they are chiefly then objects of our compaſſions, and may yet find eaſe by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church in prayer, by partaking of the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which the Saints afford them; but at the later day it will not be ſo, then is a time for <hi>juſtice,</hi> not for <hi>mercy.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">6. Obſerve here the practiſe of <hi>catechizing,</hi> or teaching Chriſtian doctrine to be as ancient as from the primitive Church in the Apoſtles dayes. Note, that then alſo, they who had the happineſſe to receive the benefit of being <hi>catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> were exhorted to repend the ſpiritual courteſie, by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rewards of relief to the Apoſtles. Note laſtly, that <hi>cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing</hi> was by <hi>word</hi> of mouth, not by writing performed; for it was indeed prohibited in thoſe times to commit to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the myſteries of faith, leſt the Infidels ſhould profane them as they came to their view: and yet now what huge force the Reformers put in the Scripture, as if it alone avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and <hi>tradition</hi> were nothing worth, whereas both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make up one perfect Record of Chriſtian doctrine.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. This verſe may either be refer'd to that immediate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or to the fourth above; as who ſhould ſay, <hi>deceive</hi> not your ſelves by pretending excuſes from relieving their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wants, who afford you the <hi>spiritual</hi> helps of Chriſtian doctrine; ſo S. Auguſtine, Theophylactus, and S. Hierome expound this place: or as more generally others expound it, delude not your ſelves, for you cannot couſen God by ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off your <hi>burthens</hi> upon other mens ſhoulders, you <hi>ſhall bear your own,</hi> for God knowes which are yours, and you cannot couſen him; and thus it reports to the fifth verſe as above, <hi>let each one bear his own burthen.</hi> So the metaphor
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:204830:427"/> imports that this life is a husbandry, a time of ſowing; the next is that of <hi>reaping,</hi> according as we have <hi>ſowed here,</hi> if good works then good reward, if bad then puniſhment.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. This verſe S. Hierome, and the reſt above interpret as they did that of the <hi>catechized;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, if you <hi>ſow the ſeed of almes</hi> to thoſe that <hi>inſtruct</hi> you, you ſhall <hi>reap</hi> the reward, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is heaven; if you <hi>ſow</hi> penury, and relieve them not, you ſhall receive, or <hi>reap corruption.</hi> But the common ſenſe is that the fruit of carnality is diſeaſe, <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> death, damnation; that of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> vertue, life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, glory, and ſalvation.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. The Apoſtle here exhorts to a perſeverance in <hi>doing good,</hi> the Prieſt conſtantly continuing to teach, the Lay to learn, to relieve his teacher, and to work according as he is taught; as if inceſſant reward were not otherwiſe to be hoped, but for inceſſant labour. So as we may underſtand this in two ſorts, we <hi>ſhall reap in due time</hi> (in the next world) if we do not ceaſe our labours in this; or we ſhall even in this world <hi>reap</hi> inceſſant reward <hi>in due time,</hi> for our labours here, if we labour conſtantly, and ſlack not our zeales, ſince it is the end that crownes the work either with grace <hi>in due time</hi> here, or glory <hi>in due time</hi> in the next world.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. That is, <hi>whileſt we have time to ſow the ſeeds of good works,</hi> let us do <hi>good</hi> to all people, Chriſtians, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; not onely to thoſe we <hi>catechize,</hi> though principally to Chriſtians, as being <hi>domeſticals,</hi> and of one houſe with us, fellow ſervants in the Church of Chriſt, the true houſe of God.</p>
                        </div>

                           <head>The Application.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. THe laſt Sundayes ſervice and this do ſeem to be almoſt the ſame, onely that was a more general Application to all mankind, this to the choſen ſort of men, who make up the myſtical body of Chriſt his holy Church. Wherefore S. Paul in this Epiſtle makes his addreſſe particularly to the Prieſts, and Paſtours of our ſoules, from the firſt verſe to the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:204830:427"/> end of the fifth; at the ſixth he begins to tell the ſheep their duty to the ſhepherd, and ſo continues to the end of the eighth verſe; in the two laſt verſes he concludes with an exhortation to them of <hi>perſeverance</hi> in their Chriſtian duties, bidding them <hi>do good to all</hi> men whatſoever, but eſpecially to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to the <hi>domesticals of Faith,</hi> to thoſe who have not onely Chriſt their Father, but do profeſſe his holy Spouſe (the Church) to be their Mother.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. We ſee by the Illuſtration above that the Prieſts office to us is double; the one to cleanſe us, by adminiſtring the holy Sacraments unto us; the other to defend us, by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praying, and offering up their daily ſacrifices for us. Hence we muſt conclude, our duty conſiſts in preparing our ſelves worthily for receiving thoſe Sacraments from the hands of the Prieſts, leſt we incurr the cenſures of unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, no leſſe then <hi>our own damnation</hi> if it be the Sacrament of the holy Altar that we do receive; and if any other of them, there hangs <hi>a curſe</hi> at leaſt upon all who <hi>perform the work of God negligently;</hi> as all unworthy receivers of any Sacraments do, or the negligent hearers of any Sermons, or of Maſſe, which is the ſacrifice as well of the people, as of the Prieſt: and theſe are peculiarly indeed <hi>the works of God,</hi> as being inſtituted by his ſacred Son; nay more, they are the works of his <hi>continued mercy</hi> towards us, and ſo ſurpaſſe all other his works whatſoever, becauſe we are told <hi>his mercy is above all his works.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. Hence the Prieſt is put in mind (further then in the Explication above) with what a holy <hi>intention, attention, reverence,</hi> and <hi>zeal of ſoules</hi> he ought to adminiſter any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and alſo how with the like regards he ought to preach, or offer up his ſacrifices, thereby to comply with the truſt of Sayntity which both God and man have put into his hands, leſt he incurr the odious brand of <hi>becoming like the people, ſo the Prieſt:</hi> for how ever both are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to God, yet the Prieſts are ſet apart as Saints to the eyes of men, and they peculiarly were thoſe he bade <hi>be holy as himſelf was holy</hi> who made <hi>them diſpenſers of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:204830:428"/> the myſteries of God</hi> unto the people. Laſtly, hence the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are minded with what <hi>humility, reverence, fear, and trembling;</hi> yet with what <hi>confidence, comfort, obedience,</hi> with what <hi>Faith,</hi> what <hi>hope,</hi> what <hi>love,</hi> with what <hi>adoration,</hi> with what <hi>zeal to God Almighties honour and glory</hi> they ought to receive the holy Sacraments, to hear the Word of God, to aſſiſt at the ſacrifice of Maſſe, which is not onely a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration, but even a renovation, a repetition (in a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious way) of our Saviours death and paſſion; ſo they are to look upon the Prieſt going to the Altar with the ſame devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as if they did behold our Saviour going to be crucified.</p>
                           <q>Now that both may do this our holy Mother prayes to day, as above, for that ſpecial gift of God, that <hi>bounty</hi> whereby it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, that ardent <hi>charity</hi> which ſets on fire the world of fleſh, and makes it flye out into flames of holy <hi>love</hi> unto his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Majeſty; for by this <hi>love</hi> it is that the Church militant is <hi>govern'd,</hi> and by the ſame <hi>love</hi> God is glorified for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in his Church Triumphant.</q>

                           <p n="11">11. THis was a fair <hi>Citie</hi> in Galilee within two miles of mount Thabor; and ſo had the name of <hi>Faire,</hi> for <hi>Naim</hi> imports as much. This made the ſadder funerall, and the more gladſome miracle being in ſo vaſt, ſo famous a <hi>City,</hi> into which ſo <hi>great a multitude,</hi> ſuch a train of people follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Saviour.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. This ſeeming chance to man of two ſuch <hi>multitudes</hi> meeting (thoſe within, and thoſe without the <hi>City</hi>) at the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, was deſigned by God, to render more authenticall the miracle, God thereby more glorified, and Chriſt the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved: though it is to be noted, that the Jews, and Romans too had their burials alwayes out of the <hi>Cities,</hi> unleſſe (rarely) for Kings, who were buried in the <hi>Citie</hi> of Sion, David build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place for that purpoſe. Note, this <hi>onely ſonne</hi> was alſo her <hi>onely</hi> child; hence <hi>the mothers</hi> ſorrow was greater to loſe in him all the whole hopes of her houſe, being <hi>a widdow</hi> of note, and ſo paſt hopes of more of that family.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. By ſaying to her <hi>weep not,</hi> he ſhewed his compaſſion of her ſorrow was ſuch, that he meant to take away the cauſe of her tears by reſtoring her ſon to life again; and ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe believed when he bade her <hi>weep</hi> no more.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. See how ſoon the promiſed comforts of God arrive:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:204830:429"/> immediately as he ſaid to her <hi>weep not,</hi> he ſtopt the hearſe, and bade the dead corps <hi>ariſe.</hi> Elias, Eliſeus, and others did pray to raiſe the dead; Chriſt, to ſhew he was God, raiſed this young man by command, and not by prayer. Yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, he <hi>touched the hearſe;</hi> no marvel upon the <hi>touch</hi> of Chriſt, who was life everlaſting, (as being God) that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life ſhould be reſtored to the dead body that he <hi>touched;</hi> this he did as naturally as a red hot iron burneth ſtraw. So did his fleſh (united to the Word) give life to a carcaſſe by virtue of that hypoſtaticall union.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. His <hi>ſitting up, and beginning to ſpeak</hi> were indeed true ſignes of his reviving; yet Chriſt was pleaſed to take him by the hand, and thereby lift him from the hearſe, and lead him to <hi>his mother,</hi> to ſhew that he was ſo humble as he would not onely oblige, but even ſerve his ſervants: Nor is it any wonder that Chriſt the King of Heaven and Earth ſhould perform the office of a Courtier by his civility to the noble perſon of this ſad <hi>widdow,</hi> whom he had graced and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by that act of his power.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. Note, this miracle was a kind of <hi>Parable,</hi> importing the ſpirituall death of ſouls by ſinne, and the reviving of the ſoul again by grace; though here the <hi>widdowes tears</hi> were the motive for Chriſt to reward her, by the reſtoring her ſon to life, and withall many ſouls doubtleſſe from the death of infidelitie to the life of Chriſtianitie upon the ſight of ſo celebrated a miracle. That they were all ſtruck <hi>with fear,</hi> what wonder? for their guiltie conſcience might make them doubt, he who could raiſe the dead could kill the living as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily if he liſt; but ſeeing he did not ſo, (or rather leſt he ſhould do ſo) they bleſſed God, and ſaid (<hi>for magnifying</hi> here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth glorifying of him) he had pleaſed <hi>to viſit his people</hi> by ſending them a <hi>great Prophet,</hi> for as yet they underſtood Chriſt to be no more, and that he was ſuch this very act made them believe, and ſome doubtleſſe concluded he was the long expected Meſſias, whom they called by the name of the <hi>great Prophet</hi> for diſtinction ſake. Note, the gloſſe obſerves three reſuſcitations from death to be made by Chriſt; the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:204830:429"/> firſt, that of the daughter of the Archi-ſynagogue, and that by private prayer in her fathers houſe none being by: the ſecond, this of the onely ſonne of the <hi>widdow,</hi> whom he raiſed in publick by a word of command, and by a <hi>touch</hi> of his hand: the third was that of Lazarus, whom with a perplexitie of prayer and tears he raiſed, and with loud crying out, <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus come forth,</hi> as if he were undone if he had him not alive again. The firſt of theſe ſignifies ſouls dead by mortall ſinne of thought, and thoſe therefore were more eaſily raiſed, by private prayer; the ſecond ſignifies thoſe dead by mortall ſin of words, thoſe are yet with more difficultie raiſed, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; the third yet more hardly, by importune <hi>prayer, tears, and cries to heaven,</hi> as ſignifying thoſe ſouls which are dead by mortall ſinne of deed, and that reiterated, or habituall unto them.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. ALl Expoſitours agree, this miracle of raiſing the dead by a <hi>touch</hi> of our Saviours holy hand, is a mere figure of his raiſing ſouls from the death of mortall ſinne to the life of grace by the <hi>finger</hi> of the holy Ghoſt, by the gift of his holy grace, his holy <hi>Law,</hi> which cannot <hi>touch</hi> a ſoul, but it muſt needs enliven it. See the explication of the laſt verſe in the Goſpel for more to this purpoſe.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. And who can now forbid us piouſly to thinke this <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne</hi> of the diſtreſſed widdow repreſents the ſoul of ſome one faithfull believer, dead yet for want of <hi>charitie,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived by the tears and prayers of his tender mother the holy Catholick Church; at whoſe interceſſion (and in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of her tears) our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt ſends down the holy Ghoſt, <hi>to touch the Coffin</hi> of this ſinners heart with the <hi>finger</hi> of his grace, with the gift, the flame of <hi>Love,</hi> and ſo reviving him firſt internally, then gives him by the hands of the Prieſt (who is Chriſts Vicar in point of abſolution) into the lap of his mother, externally to live again, that is to ſay, admitted to the Sacraments, and declared to be a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:204830:430"/> living member, as before his death of mortall ſinne, during which time he was not capable of any Sacrament at all, as to the effect, the grace thereof?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To conclude, as reaſon teaches every man to beware of his own danger by ſeeing another periſh in going ſuch a way before him; thus holy Church, knowing her Prieſts, and people are many wayes liable to the ſnares of the common enemy, and perceiving it is often by the prayers of thoſe that ſtand, they are raiſed again who fall, and that this raiſing is a <hi>continuall mercy</hi> of Almighty God <hi>gratis</hi> given, (even when moſt earneſtly implored) and that the <hi>continuation</hi> of this gratuite gift is the onely means by which even all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Church do not fall, all at once into the death of deadly ſinne, but are many of them (while others fall) inabled to ſtand ſecurely on their living legs of <hi>charitie,</hi> and are <hi>governed</hi> thereby, in every ſtep they make to glory; <q>Therefore, I ſay, we are to day bid pray as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, that this <hi>charitie, this bountie</hi> of our Lord <hi>may govern us</hi> in all our wayes, and that we may have the <hi>cleanſing and the defending mercy of God continued over us,</hi> leſt that fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, we here fall out of grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by faile of glory in the world to come.</q>

Juſt thus it is with holy Churches preaching; admit a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of people be aſſembled to one ſole Preacher in the pulpit, is his Sermon ever the worſe becauſe it dynts the ſoul of every hearer there? and moves him ſo, as if the Preacher knew the heart of every auditour he had? (whom yet he never ſaw in all his life, nor knowes him now he ſees him) would any man condemn this Preacher? No, admire him rather, and in him adore Almighty God, who with one ſpeech could touch the quick of every ſoul alive. And ſo it is with holy Churches prayers; the commoner they are, the more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly they touch each pious perſons ſoul; if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, they ſeem to reach as far as all the preachers of the Church can ſcrue into a ſoul, and farther too; for who ſo ſayes them with a zeal ſuitable to the Spirit whence they flow, he like a river runs into the ſea whence all the waters have their ſpring, and is not loſt although he be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Note, the word <hi>Vocation</hi> is of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regard, and ſo imports a ſpeciall obligation they had to comply with their ſaid <hi>vocation,</hi> which was indeed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from Gentiliſme to Chriſtianitie.</p>

By the word <hi>bond</hi> is underſtood removing private ſenſe in point of religion, for a <hi>bond</hi> imports a tie between parties, and ſo abandons ſingularitie, when it muſt binde many together in the <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>unanimitie.</hi>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:204830:446"/> of our Lord, of faith, of Baptiſme, of God</hi> &amp;c. he means, our <hi>unanimitie</hi> muſt not conſiſt of our being all of one mind with one another, (for ſo are many that are not true <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi>) but that we ought to be all <hi>of one mind</hi> with God, who by his ſacred Son, and by the holy Ghoſt hath taught us what that <hi>one mind is</hi> of his divine Majeſty which we ſhould be of; ſuch a mind, as makes us one thing with him, how ever ſeverall things in our ſelves; that is to ſay, one my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body of Chriſt, animated <hi>by one ſpirit,</hi> believing one and the ſame <hi>faith</hi> which his ſacred Son delivered unto us; not making our own <hi>faith,</hi> ſutable to our own fancie, and calling that <hi>one ſpirit,</hi> becauſe many are of that fancy too: no, no beloved, Chriſtian <hi>unanimitie</hi> is rooted in the ſacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, where though there be a multiplicitie of Perſons, yet is there a ſimplicitie of Nature, an unitie of eſſence, an identitie of Deitie; not onely becauſe the Three diſtinct Perſons are al <hi>of one mind,</hi> but becauſe they are <hi>one</hi> and the ſame Thing, (or Beeing rather, ſince in God there is no compoſition between the Thing, and the Being thereof, as is in creatures, and ſo he is more properly called a ſimple Being, then a ſimple Thing.)

                           </p>
                           <p n="35">35. It ſeems this <hi>Doctour</hi> came not with any reall intention to entrap our Saviour, (as the other did, whereof mention is made by S. Mark c. 12.) but rather blinded the other <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> by ſeeming to ask a queſtion to their entrapping ſenſe, while in truth he did ask it to ſatisfie his own doubt in point of practicall virtue, as the <hi>Sadduces</hi> had been ſatisfied by him in the ſpeculative verity of the <hi>reſurrection;</hi> for here this <hi>Doctour</hi> did approve our Saviours anſwer, and ſaid to him, thou haſt anſwered well indeed.</p>
                           <p n="36">36. The reaſon they asked this queſtion was, in regard they much doubted whether the <hi>greateſt commandment</hi> were not that of ſacrifice Levit. c. 1. becauſe God ſeems chiefly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured thereby. And here the <hi>Phariſees</hi> abſurdly bid children refuſe to help their parents, under pretenſe of offering to God what ſhould relieve their needy parents, as if that cloak of Religion were better then this duty to nature.</p>
                           <p n="37">37. But Jeſus made them ſee there is no ſacrifice ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:204830:447"/> in the ſight of God as that of our <hi>hearts</hi> affections; and ſo he puts in the firſt place of commands that precept of <hi>charity</hi> which bids us <hi>love God above all things,</hi> with <hi>all our heart</hi> &amp;c. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe there is no precept ſo extenſive as this of love; whence you ſee it is expreſſed by giving <hi>all</hi> our affections wholly to God. This made S. Bernard bold to ſay, <q>we muſt love him beyond all meaſure, when he ſayes, the mean of love to God is to love him without mean or meaſure.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p n="38">38. Well is this therefore called the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> becauſe it is ſo <hi>per excellentiam,</hi> by excellency, as extending to a kind of infinity, when it puts no mean to <hi>our love of God,</hi> no end at all, but requires it be for ever that we love him. Hence it is that <hi>charity</hi> is the Queen of the ſoul, and life of all virtues, and is indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Religion, above ſacrifice, becauſe by <hi>charity</hi> (which is the love of the ſoul to God) ſacrifices are commanded <hi>to be made as testimonies of her loyalty to God</hi> who doth command them.</p>
                           <p n="39">39. This <hi>love of our neighbour</hi> is called the <hi>ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> in order to perfection, not in rank of law; for there were many laws made before this was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. By <hi>loving our neighbour as our ſelf</hi> is underſtood that we muſt really, truly, and cordially love him, though not ſo much as our ſelves. So by the particle <hi>as,</hi> is here underſtood ſimilitude, not identity, or equality of <hi>love.</hi>

                           <p n="42">42. Whereby, in requitall of their <hi>tempting him</hi> by a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile queſtion in the Law, which was <hi>the chief command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> he now undertakes to impart unto them a farre more ſubtile verity, and more neceſſary inſtruction, (that ſo he might with good repay evil) namely, the truth of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely Man, but God, not onely the <hi>ſonne of David,</hi> as they allowed him to be, but even <hi>the Sonne</hi> of God, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> who was expected to be the Redeemer, and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the whole world: and this he inferres upon them ſo, as by force of argument <hi>out of Davids mouth,</hi> out of the Scripture, he makes them ſee clearly it muſt be ſo; though they were too proud to confeſſe it. No marvell they could not anſwer right to the queſtion; for when S. Peter (Matth. 16.) did anſwer the ſame queſtion right, our Saviour told him <hi>fleſh, and bloud had not revealed it, but the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father,</hi> who had not ſo illuminated theſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> as he did Peter.</p>
                           <p n="43">43. Obſerve, while Chriſt makes in this verſe a further inquiry, it doth not inferre he denieth himſelf to be what they ſaid truly that he was, the ſonne of David; (for ſo the Scripture told them clearly the Meſſias ſhould be) but he was willing to draw them on to a further knowledge that the Meſſias was alſo the Sonne of God, and not onely <hi>the</hi> ſonne of David, and this out of Davids own mouth, who in <hi>ſpirit</hi> (by inſpiration from heaven) <hi>called him Lord,</hi> a ſtile which fathers do not uſe to give unto their ſonnes: and that this was true he cites <hi>Davids</hi> words in the next verſe, ſaying,</p>
                           <p n="44">44. <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord,</hi> (God ſaid to the Meſſias, to Jeſus Chriſt) by the inſtinct of the Holy Ghoſt, who did indeed dictate unto David all the whole book of Pſalms
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:204830:448"/> which runnes much upon the propheticall prediction of our Lord, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt his coming, and being the true Meſſias that was expected with ſo much fervour by the languiſhing world. So by this quotation of the Scripture where <hi>David</hi> calls <hi>Chriſt his Lord,</hi> they are brought to ſee evidently he muſt needs be more then his ſonne, elſe they had replied again, which they neither did nor durſt, nor indeed could do, as the laſt verſe of this preſent Goſpel ſhows. By <hi>ſitting at Gods right hand</hi> is clearly declared he is not onely <hi>Davids Lord,</hi> but alſo the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, true God as well as man, placed above all the quiers of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heaven, and impowered at the day of judgement to come in Majeſty, trampling over all his enemies, the world, the devil, and the fleſh, when he ſhall judge all fleſh, and all ſpirit too, man and Angels, and make his enemies truely his <hi>footstool</hi> when he tramples firſt upon them, and laſtly kicks them down to the pit of hell, where the <hi>foot</hi> of his eternall power holds them everlaſtingly under him, in pains, and torments.</p>
                           <p n="45">45. It was time for Chriſt to cloſe up the irrefragable force of his argument, by ſhewing the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> in this verſe, he being the Meſſias mentioned by the Royall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was not onely Davids, but Gods ſonne alſo; and whilſt he inferres the greater out of Davids mouth, he doth not deny the leſſer, though here he ſeems to ask how <hi>David</hi> could call his <hi>Lord</hi> his ſonne, when they themſelves did ſee he muſt alſo be Davids, and the whole worlds God, Redeemer, Judge, and Saviour too.</p>
                           <p n="46">46. And their ſilence aſſerted in this verſe to his inference, argues their conſent it was, and muſt be true; hence they were left at leaſt to wonder at, if not to believe, confeſſe, and love this undeniable truth: for of theſe S. Auguſtine, in his expoſition upon the 109. Pſalme cited by Chriſt, ſayes <q>excellently well, Theſe proud <hi>Phariſees</hi> choſe rather to burſt with the pride of their ſwollen (and ſullen) ſilence, then to be taught by their humble acknowledgement, &amp; confeſſion.</q>
                              <pb n="266" facs="tcp:204830:449"/> S. Chryſoſtome upon the ſame place ſayes, <q>They were ſtruck dumb by the dart of this dead wound they had received from Chriſt, convincing (though not converting) them.</q> So it often fares with Hereticks.</p>

                           <p>IF any man doubt what is meant by the <hi>operation of our Lords mercy</hi> mentioned in this prayer, S. Paul in the firſt verſe of this daies Epiſtle will tell him it is the <hi>actual grace of God, which the Apostle alwayes gives thanks for,</hi> as being the cauſe of the Corinthians converſion, of their being <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched in all things</hi> appertaining to Chriſtian religion, ſo <hi>as to want nothing but the revelation of Chriſt in glory,</hi> whom already they beheld in grace, as alſo of their perſeverance <hi>without crime</hi> till the day of doom in that belief, unto which by this grace they had been called. This is the ſumm of the Epiſtle, and undoubtedly this is the ſenſe of the prayer beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that as by the <hi>operation of Chriſt his mercy</hi> the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians became Chriſtians, ſo we that are by the ſame meanes of the ſame profeſſion, may by the ſame help have <hi>our hearts directed,</hi> (by the <hi>operation of our Saviours mercy towards us</hi>) by the encreaſe of his grace within us: And indeed that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is alſo properly <hi>the operation of his mercy too,</hi> for the firſt gift thereof was rather the exhibition then the <hi>operation</hi> of his holy grace, and yet to us it ſeems like an <hi>operation</hi> of it too within his own bowels, and ſo, as we ſaid above, the exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in our eyes is as the effect of his mercie upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but the encreaſe thereof is the <hi>operation of it</hi> upon us, to whom it is exhibited; ſo by the exhibition of this grace we become children of God, and by the encreaſe thereof we grow to be his champions, to live his Saints, and die his Martyrs, rather then renounce the Faith of Chriſt. Thus we ſee the firſt clauſe of this Prayer hath exhauſted the whole Epiſtle of the day: Now that the Goſpel ſhould be by the cloſe
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:204830:450"/> thereof exhauſted too, would ſeem ſtrange, if already ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger myſteries had not appeared in the myſterious prayers of holy Church. And certain it was for the depth of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that S. Gregory the great collects them all together into a book intituled <hi>of Sacraments,</hi> that is to ſay, of Myſteries, as in the preface of this book was hinted; not that the ſtile of Churches prayers is other then plain, and eaſie, but that the depth of their meaning is prodigious. We have examples in the ſimple ſtile of <hi>Thomas à Kempis,</hi> (authour of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Chriſt,) the plaineſt, and the deepeſt book that ever was written next to holy Writ; the fulleſt of common places, and yet the moſt home to every mans particular that reads it. So it is with the Churches prayers, they are in words ſimple, and facil, but in ſenſe ſuch as the deepeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding may not be able to ſound the bottome of them. For inſtance, ſee how the whole ſtory of the Goſpel is wound off by the onely cloſe of this daies prayer: (if yet the former clauſe thereof were not appropriable thereunto) For what imports the preſſing into Jeſus preſence of the paralytick, and thoſe who from the houſes top did drop him down into the room where Jeſus was, when they found not entrance any other way, but an infinite <hi>faith</hi> they had of being cured by the leaſt <hi>touch</hi> of his ſacred perſon? (and this to ſatisfie our ſelves with the letter of the ſtory, not recurring as we might to the myſtery thereof:) What, I ſay, means this paſſage elſe then a remonſtrance of this paralyticks <hi>faith</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt? And who doth not ſee the cloſe of this prayer excellently well allude <hi>to faith?</hi> ſince we read that <hi>without faith it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. Do not we Chriſtians then implicitely beg, if not the gift, (which we have already) at leaſt the encreaſe <hi>of faith</hi> when we end this prayer with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, <hi>We cannot without God pleaſe</hi> his Divine Majeſtie? that is to ſay, as without the <hi>gift of faith</hi> we can be no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at all; ſo without the encreaſe thereof (<hi>through the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſt his mercy</hi> in us,) we cannot become good Chriſtians, ſuch as by works of <hi>charity</hi> ſtill encreaſe our <hi>faith</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, and by that encreaſe deſerve with the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:204830:451"/> paralytick as well the remiſſion of our ſins, as the cure of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral diſeaſes, ſince without ſuch remiſſion we cannot <hi>pleaſe</hi> Almighty God, and <hi>without him</hi> no ſuch remiſſion can be had, that is, without <hi>his mercy operate firſt upon him</hi> to pardon us, and then upon us (when pardoned) to offend no more. (not that this <hi>operation of Gods mercy</hi> upon himſelf is any new act; but ever is, ever was, and will be one and the ſame act in him, ſeeming new to us by the new effects it produceth in us.) So every way is it an undoubted truth, that <hi>without him we can no wayes pleaſe him:</hi> And thus do we ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt the prayers of holy Church unto the other ſervice of the day.</p>

                           <p n="4">4. IN theſe words, S. Paul <hi>gives thanks to God inceſſant for the grace of Chriſt which was given</hi> to the Corinthians, who thereby were made Chriſtians. An excellent leſſon, and ought to be frequently practiſed by us, to acknowledge that our perſeverance is a continuation of our vocation to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. In <hi>all things</hi> appertaining to your religion. <hi>Rich in him, (rich by him)</hi> that doth enrich you every hour by preſerving you in the ſame vocation he hath called you unto. <hi>In all ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance,</hi> (in all your words) whereby is preached this faith. <hi>In all knowledge,</hi> (in all true ſpiritual underſtanding the doctrine of Chriſt) as who ſhould ſay, I thank God that hath by mine, and by Apollo's preaching afforded you all underſtanding, and true ſenſe of the doctrine of Chriſt, the Goſpel we have delivered unto you.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The particle <hi>as,</hi> here imports as much as if he had ſaid, by theſe two means, namely of our preaching, and your (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by) tightly underſtanding the true ſenſe of Chriſts doctrine <hi>you are confirmed in</hi> Chriſt, (in your belief of his veracity) and ſo he becomes <hi>confirmed</hi> in you by theſe infallible <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> you have of him, our preaching, and your right belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. See here how abſolutely right maſters the Apoſtles were, how abſolutely true ſchollars, or diſciples the Corinthians were of Chriſt, to whom <hi>nothing is wanting in any grace</hi> that can be requiſite to their confirmation who are true children of Chriſt, who have ſuch maſters, and who are ſuch believers as the Corinthians were. So that what remained was onely to ſee all they had heard, and believed of Chriſt to be verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by his <hi>revealing</hi> the certainty thereof at his ſecond coming in the day of Judgment, when this perfect, and fertile grace ſhall bring forth in them the fruits of glory in the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. This verſe alludes to the preſent grace of Chriſt which
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:204830:452"/> the Apoſtle ſayes ſhould <hi>confirm</hi> them now in their <hi>belief,</hi> (meaning the Church, not every particular member thereof) and render them both here till then, and at the <hi>day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inculpable</hi> for their having thus believed, being thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God, and thus inſtructed by the Apoſtles.</p>

                           <head>The Application.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. WE heard laſt Sunday how this Apoſtle ſummed up to his Epheſian Converts thoſe particular vertues that were proper for new converted ſoules; now to day he ſpeaks to the Corinthians much in the ſame ſtile, they being newly (by his means) then made good Chriſtians: onely here the Apoſtle inſiſts much upon the effects of that grace in them which wrought their converſion, and thoſe effects how excellent they are the Explication of the Text above hath told us.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It remains therefore that all Catholick Chriſtians, while they read this Text which minds them of their like converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amidſt a thouſand millions of men who want that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſet their <hi>charity</hi> on work immediately, to produce the like effects in their ſoules, by the operation of the grace they have received, to be, and to perſevere in that ſaving <hi>Faith, which works it ſelf by charity</hi> out of grace into glory at that latter day, when <hi>every one ſhall receive according to their works.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. As therefore the gift of <hi>Faith</hi> wrought upon our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and <hi>directed</hi> them to an aſſent to myſteries above the reach of reaſon; ſo <hi>charity</hi> is to <hi>direct</hi> our <hi>wills</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt things above nature, ſuch as are all <hi>good works</hi> done for a ſupernatural end: Now becauſe all ſuch works are the effects of grace, and not of nature, and becauſe grace is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us <hi>by the operation</hi> of <hi>God his mercy</hi> towards us, who <hi>mercifully operates</hi> that in us, which we our ſelves may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate unto, but cannot operate <hi>without his helping hand,</hi> without <hi>the operation of his mercy</hi> upon us (even towards
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:204830:452"/> our cooperation) which is indeed his holy grace <hi>working</hi> in us;</p>

                           <p n="2">2. <hi>They bring him a paralytick</hi> in his bed; the reaſon was that men ſick of this diſeaſe loſe the uſe of their joynts, can neither go, ſtand, nor ſit. Here we may learn not onely to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour our own, but our neighbours wellfare; for this <hi>paralytick</hi> was brought doubtleſſe by thoſe who, having ſeen the works of Chriſt, and his wonders, were zealous to bring this ſick man on their ſhoulders to the fountain of health. S. Marke ſayes c. 2. v. 3. there were foure did bring this man to Chriſt. And by the following words in this verſe is evinced what we have already ſaid of theſe mens zeals, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So Chriſt ſeeing the <hi>faith</hi> of theſe men who brought him with this zeal, ſaid to the <hi>paralytick</hi> in recompenſe of his, <hi>and their faiths</hi> who brought him, (for the Text runs in the plurall number) <hi>Sonne be of good heart, thy ſinnes are forgiven thee.</hi> By theſe words we ſee the <hi>faith</hi> of miracles is, and muſt be mixed with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident hope of obtaining the favour asked, which we believe is in his power to grant that we do ask it of; and this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hope is that which chears up <hi>the heart,</hi> which Chriſt bade this <hi>paralytick</hi> continue. Great is ſeen to be the benignitie, grace, and favour ſhown by Chriſt to this poore diſeaſed creature, when he calls him <hi>childe,</hi> and to make him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that denomination, <hi>forgives him his ſinnes,</hi> to ſhew he was not onely a corporall but a ſpirituall Phyſician, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:204830:453"/> had power over ſouls as well as over bodies: Nor is it mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell he firſt heals the ſoul of <hi>ſinne</hi> by remitting it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cures the body of this <hi>paralytick,</hi> ſince commonly ſinne in the ſoul is the cauſe of diſeaſes in the body, ſo that this was even a due order to cure the diſeaſe by taking away the cauſe thereof: beſides, ſince <hi>all Gods workes are perfect,</hi> it is conſonant to Chriſt his dignitie, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being God to doe the worke completely, to cure the man both body, and ſoul; and this indeed is commonly found to be the practiſe of Chriſt in moſt of his cures, ſince his aime in all his miracles was the converſion of ſouls: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he came purpoſely into the world to take away the ſinnes thereof: But a main reaſon why here he did remit ſin was to ſhew himſelf to be God; by exerciſing that power which then none ever had done before, (nor ſince, but by commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from our Lord.)</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And here we ſee in this verſe the Jewes were ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at him, for preſuming to claime a power they thought was ſo much above him, as they held it <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> in our Saviour to exerciſe the ſame; whence Saint Marke recounting this ſtory addes c. 2. v. 7. that they ſaid, <hi>who can remit ſinne but God alone?</hi> yet theſe their thoughts Saint Matthew here doth not ſay they expreſſed, but that Chriſt knew them as well as if they had done ſo, as is clear by the following verſe.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Note, by Chriſt's <hi>ſeeing their thoughts</hi> we are here to underſtand he <hi>ſees them</hi> by his owne power, not as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets who by revelation ſee, and know hidden myſteries, but as illuminated by his own (not any extrinſecall) ſpirit, as he was God the knower, and ſearcher of hearts. So by this they did not onely ſee he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but alſo that he was God, ſince it was onely foretold of the great Prophet the Meſſias that he ſhould remit ſinnes, which Chriſt to prove himſelf to be did practiſe upon this <hi>paralytick.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. It is not onely <hi>eaſier</hi> to ſay to a lame man <hi>walke,</hi> then <hi>to remit ſinne,</hi> but it is raſier to create the whole world then
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:204830:454"/> to forgive <hi>ſinne;</hi> and this becauſe <hi>ſinne</hi> is a nothing more removed from God then any other nothing can be: So to draw being out of any other not being, or nothing, requires leſſe power then to give the being of grace to him that was annihilated in the nothing of ſinne; as who ſhould ſay one were leſſe a child of God by being a ſinner, then nothing is (in reſpect of being) a creature. For nothing is onely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, or privatively oppoſite to God, but ſinne is diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite, as a contrary inconſiſtent with him; nay, there are no contraries ſo oppoſite as God and ſinne are. Laſtly, the remiſſion of ſinne produceth an effect ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, to wit, grace, but creation gives onely a naturall being to a creature. Note here, Chriſt doth not aske <hi>whether is it eaſier to forgive ſinne,</hi> or to cure the ſick, but to ſay, thy <hi>ſinnes are forgiven,</hi> or to ſay <hi>riſe and walke;</hi> for though it may ſeem the firſt is harder, yet in earneſt the laſt is the hardeſt, becauſe the firſt cannot ſo eaſily be diſproved as the laſt; for if one ſay, <hi>riſe and walke,</hi> unleſſe it be done it is eaſily ſaid a man ſpoke beyond his power, but tis not ſo if one ſay, <hi>thy ſinne is forgiven thee,</hi> for none can tell but it may be true.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Note, by <hi>the Sonne of Man</hi> in this verſe is proved that Chriſt (as man) had power to forgive ſinnes, elſe he had come ſhort in power of his Apoſtles to whom as to men he gave faculty to remit ſinnes alſo, and therefore this facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie muſt needs be more proper to himſelf as man, ſince no man can give another what is not in his own power. And this power of ſuperexcellence in Chriſt conſiſts in foure things: The firſt, that the merit, and power of his paſſion is it which operates in the Sacraments chiefly. The ſecond, that in his name Sacraments are made holy. The third, that he is the inſtituter of them. The fourth, that he by his ſpeciall prerogative can give the effect of Sacraments without the Sacraments, remiſſion of ſinnes, or grace. And this power is proper to Chriſt alone, for neither Saint Peter, nor any Pope elſe ever had, or can have it. That he ſpeakes to the <hi>paralytick,</hi> not to the Phariſees argues they were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:204830:454"/> at him, as if they did not believe him, ſo he turns to the ſick man, ſaying, <hi>Riſe, take up thy bed, and goe home:</hi> and by this done, as well as ſaid, it was proved evidently both that he was God, and man, for the cure was wrought to prove he had power on earth to forgive ſinnes. That you may know ſaith he, <hi>the Sonne of God can remit ſinnes,</hi> I confirm it by this miracle bidding this <hi>ſicke man riſe, take up his bed, and walke;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, I confirme one truth by another, my being God, by ſhewing you I am the Meſſias, and can heale both ſoules, and bodies too.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. 8. By this act of doing as he was bid the ſick man gave undoubted proof to them all, that as well his ſinnes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as his diſeaſe cured; for they ſeeing him obey the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den command who was before not able to ſtirre, fell all out of admiration into a <hi>fear</hi> of that power, for which they <hi>glorified God,</hi> to wit, chiefly that of <hi>forgiving ſins;</hi> which they had not before ſeen any proof of in other Prophets do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in their own names as Chriſt now did, though often they had ſeen, and heard of corporall cures, and great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles done by other Prophets. So this admiration, and the effect thereof, this their <hi>fear,</hi> was grounded chiefly in that power they ſee Chriſt exerciſe of <hi>remitting ſins,</hi> and of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame power by another of curing the paralytick alſo of his corporall diſeaſe; and hence they ſeeing admired, admiring <hi>feared,</hi> and <hi>fearing glorified God who had given ſuch power</hi> (namely of forgiving ſinnes) <hi>unto man;</hi> for that was it Chriſt undertook to prove, that the <hi>ſonne of man</hi> had power to <hi>forgive ſinnes,</hi> which when firſt they heard they thought he <hi>blaſphemed,</hi> but now they reſted ſatisfied it was true, and <hi>glorified</hi> God becauſe they found it true by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of this prodigious miracle.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. SEe how ſuitable this Goſpel is to the Epiſtle. What was the cure done here, but an <hi>operation of mercy</hi> in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, giving this ſick man firſt the <hi>gift of faith,</hi> next that of <hi>charity</hi> to work a ſorrow in him for his ſinnes, and laſtly the effect of that ſorrow, <hi>abſolution</hi> from the guilt of ſinne, and reſtitution of his uſeleſſe limbs to their naturall uſes, by the corporall cure of his <hi>palſie,</hi> ſuperadded to the ſpirituall cure of his ſinfull ſoul, as was ſaid partly in the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration, partly in the Explication above?</p>
                           <p n="2">2.

                           <p>WHo can enough admire the depth of the Holy Ghoſt that in this prayer, nay even in one emphaticall word, or two thereof hath ſummed up not onely the Epiſtle, and Goſpel of the day, but the whole ſtory in a manner of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane generation? For what elſe do we find in the Epiſtle but
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:204830:456"/> S. Paul adviſing the Epheſians <hi>to put on the new man,</hi> and caſt off the old? what elſe in the Goſpel but a very good reaſon given us for doing thus, by the <hi>parable</hi> of him who was not onely ſhut out of the wedding room becauſe he had not put on his nuptiall garment, but alſo was <hi>caſt into outward dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> &amp;c. And what doth this mind us of leſſe then of old Adams ſtory, caſt out of <hi>paradiſe</hi> becauſe God found him there without his wedding garment, without his originall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? Now that the prayer above doth ſweetly ſumme up this, will not perhaps ſo eaſily appear, untill we find ſome tranſcendentall word or other which unlocks all the myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meaning of the prayer. What if the word <hi>exclude</hi> go far in doing this? when we <hi>beſeech our almighty, and mercifull God</hi> that he wil vouchſafe <hi>propitiouſly to exclude al things which are adverſe unto us?</hi> Certainly when <hi>all adverſity</hi> is <hi>excluded</hi> from us, God hath given us a fair teſtimony that we are included in his favour, and have no bar between us, and our eternall happineſſe. O! had Adam been ſo happy to have ſaid this prayer, and to have had the graunt of his petition, (the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <hi>excluded</hi> out of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which we ſee was a huge <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi> let in unto him) our danger had not been as now it is to be ſhut out of heaven gates for want of our <hi>wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and caſt <hi>into outward darkneſse,</hi> into the pit of hell; unleſſe we may by praying as above obtain to have all things <hi>excluded which are adverſe unto us,</hi> leſt if any one of <hi>all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities</hi> enter in upon us, we prove as weak, as frail as Adam did, and let that one enemy caſt us out of all our felicity temporall, and eternall. For while we let in but any one, he fetters us immediately, he hampers our affections, and makes us (ſilly fools) to doat upon our own undoing. Whence we pray that <hi>all adverſity may be excluded;</hi> and that by this means being ſet <hi>at liberty both in mind and body,</hi> we may with <hi>free ſouls execute thoſe things which appertain to Almighty God;</hi> for <hi>free ſouls</hi> import ſuch as are not fetterred with the ſhackles of <hi>adverſity,</hi> and ſinne. If any ask what thoſe things are <hi>which appertain to God:</hi> why, nothing more then we are told in the Epiſtle, and Goſpel, <hi>to put off the old man, and put
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:204830:456"/> on the new,</hi> ſuch as is <hi>according to God created in juſtice, and holineſſe of truth,</hi> that thereby we may be capable of the happy <hi>appertaining</hi> to ſo great a maſter, ſo good a God; and conſequently ſuch, as hath <hi>excluded lying, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, theft,</hi> and (together with all his other ſinfull children) <hi>the devil</hi> himſelf, not <hi>giving</hi> him any the leaſt <hi>place</hi> in the ſoul. And when we have put off <hi>the old man,</hi> (therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led old becauſe he is ſinfull as old Adam was) then we may hope to have <hi>put on the new;</hi> or to ſpeak more properly to the letter of the prayer, (though this be a good ſenſe thereof) then <hi>God will put us on the new:</hi> For 'tis indeed he that muſt <hi>create us,</hi> he that muſt <hi>renew us in the spirit of the mind,</hi> he that muſt make us juſt, and <hi>give us the holineſſe of truth;</hi> ours is the negative, his the poſitive part of ſanctity; we muſt firſt (by his holy grace) decline evil, and then he will make us (by virtue of the ſame grace) do good; we muſt <hi>not lie, not be angry, not ſteal,</hi> in a word not ſinne, as this Epiſtle tells us, for theſe things appertain to the devil, and then we may hope to be the <hi>new</hi> created Saints whom the Goſpel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits with <hi>wedding garments</hi> in to the <hi>wedding feast.</hi> But in regard we find difficulty in our declining evil, or in our not ſinning, therefore the prayer petitions that God will <hi>vouchſafe propitiouſly</hi> to <hi>exclude all adverſities</hi> out of doors; (and by <hi>all adverſity</hi> we mean all ſinne) for if he leave it to us we ſhall certainly let ſin in, and by ſo doing cauſe Almighty God to <hi>ſhut us out</hi> of heaven gates, and caſt us <hi>into outward dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> for want of our <hi>wedding garment,</hi> the livery of the <hi>new man, who according to God is created in juſtice, and holineſſe of truth;</hi> who is not onely <hi>called</hi> but <hi>elected</hi> too, ſelected for eternall happineſſe, by God having <hi>excluded all adverſity from him,</hi> and made him <hi>freely execute thoſe things which appertain</hi> to his Divine Majeſty, to be holy here, and glorious in the life to come.</p>

By ſaying, <hi>this new man is created to God,</hi> the Apoſtle meanes to the image, or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, namely ſupernatural: for even as Adam the firſt of men was not ſo properly ſaid to be made like to God in reſpect of the natural creature he appeared to be, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his inviſible, and ſupernatural being, that is in grace, ſanctitie, and truth; ſo in us the <hi>new man</hi> imports the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, which <hi>according to God was created in us</hi> when by holy Baptiſme we were regenerated: whence we are truly created <hi>ſpiritual</hi> men by grace, as often as from ſinners we become Saints, from unjuſt juſt, from vicious holy, from falſe true children of Almighty God.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. And that we may be preſerved, (which is, continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly created) and by new acts of grace become more and more Saints, in this verſe the Apoſtle bids us <hi>cast away</hi> all falſhood, all deceit, all <hi>lying,</hi> as members of the <hi>old man,</hi> and not fit to be about the <hi>new</hi> one. For ſince Chriſtians have that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe to be <hi>members one of another,</hi> as far forth as they make up the myſtical body of Chriſt their Head, therefore the Apoſtle tells them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ought to be as exact in telling truth to one another, as the members of our natural body are exact each in the true performance of their duties, the hand removing, not laying danger in the heads way, nor in the way
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:204830:458"/> of any other members of the body, the feet bearing up, and not letting fall the bulk of the walking body, intruſted to them whileſt the man is walking: and this natural fidelitie in our natural members the Apoſtle exhibits unto us as an example of our veracity, and truth to one another, who are <hi>ſpiritual members</hi> each to other, and conſequently bound to be as faithful to our neighbour, as ſincere to him when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes upon us, as our feet to the whole body whoſe weight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies on them, and who walks in confidence they will not let the body fall: whence it followes, that a lie to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is as great a breach of truſt as if we tripped up his heeles whileſt he walks confident of our bidding him relie upon our ſupporting of him, when yet by <hi>lying</hi> we deceive his truſt.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. The Apoſtle doth not here command <hi>anger,</hi> but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it juſt, he bids us take heed it become not unjuſt, or proceed not <hi>to ſinne;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, if you be juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to <hi>anger</hi> againſt any <hi>evil</hi> in others, take heed it proceed not <hi>to ſin</hi> in your-ſelves. Juſt <hi>anger</hi> is that which Saints have againſt ſin, not againſt ſinners, which parents have againſt children offending, which Princes have againſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Law, when they puniſh the offenders for their faults without ſin in themſelves, ſuch as holy David meant was fit to have againſt Idolaters, and perſecutours of the juſt. And indeed there is a kind of innate neceſſity in man to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> namely, that which makes him uſe violence for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving obſtacles in his way to any heroical, noble, and juſt atchievement. This <hi>anger</hi> the Apoſtle bids us ſo uſe, as we take heed not to abuſe it by letting it riſe to the malice of a <hi>ſin</hi> in us. And when <hi>the ſun is</hi> forbid <hi>to fall</hi> upon <hi>our anger,</hi> he exhorts us to forbear continuing in it; not that he allowes a continued act of <hi>anger</hi> all day, provided we ceaſe to be <hi>angry</hi> at night, but that rather it ſhould paſſe as faſt as the ſun doth over our heads, that rather if we were <hi>angry</hi> towards ſun-ſetting, we ſhould be ſure to be quieted ere it were ſet, that is immediately. Note, the Apoſtle here by <hi>anger</hi> meanes not the habit, but the act thereof; nor yet the moderate act of it
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:204830:458"/> neither when he bids the <hi>ſun ſhould not fall upon our anger,</hi> for he means an exceſſe of <hi>anger,</hi> a fury, or wrath, leſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (as bees do when they ſting) we weaken our own vertues by acting revenge upon our neighbour, and ſo endanger to ſleep in ſin, which is underſtood by the <hi>ſun ſetting on our anger,</hi> and thereby hazzard the loſſe of our own ſoul, that may in ſleep depart without repentance; which cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably happen in the day time, and conſequently diurnal <hi>anger</hi> is not ſo dangerous as nocturnal.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. And that this is the Apoſtles true meaning in the verſe above, theſe following words teſtifie; For it is to <hi>give place</hi> or way <hi>to the devil,</hi> to leave our ſelves at his mercy as it were, at his advantage when we ſleep in ſin, or when indeed we do waking continue in any ſinful act with deliberation; though it is alſo true that nothing layes us ſo much expoſed to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> as <hi>anger,</hi> for it is a vice which takes away reaſon above all others, inſomuch as we uſually ſay men act not like men but like beaſts when they are furious; and though a ſudden fury may excuſe ſometimes from ſin, yet a continued one doth ever aggravate it, and thereby gives more and more <hi>place to the devil,</hi> which wrath or fury the Apoſtle here dehorteth from.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. He that when he was a Gentile did <hi>ſteal,</hi> now that he is a Chriſtian <hi>let him not ſteal,</hi> becauſe perfection is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at his hands: and to this perfection he muſt approach by degrees, firſt caſting off his old vices; nay, rather then <hi>ſteal</hi> for want of meanes to live himſelf, <hi>let him labour</hi> about any good imployment, that he may be able <hi>to give</hi> unto thoſe who are in want, and by ſo doing prevent in them the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>ſtealing</hi> too. So that Chriſtian perfection ſtops not at moving every one to do good in himſelf, but proceeds to prevent evil in others, and ſo to prevent it, as even by our handy labours to take away the cauſe that may tempt others to ill, rather then for want of our <hi>labour</hi> expoſe them to the danger of evil doing. By <hi>labouring that which is good</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood uſing honeſt <hi>labour,</hi> and that for honeſt ends, not for lucre, or unjuſt ſordid gain, the temptation whereof will
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:204830:459"/> ceaſe if we make it the end of our <hi>labour</hi> to do works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to others, ſuch as is relieving them in their <hi>neceſſity.</hi> And if to this end even Church-men <hi>labour,</hi> they will not want the example of it given them by the Apoſtles who did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the ſame as well as preach it.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. BY this way of <hi>parables</hi> Chriſt did often inſtruct, and illuminate the Jewes, who were very intentive to any <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical</hi> ſenſe, and much pleaſed therewith.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. By the <hi>Kingdome of heaven</hi> is here underſtood the Church militant, which is truly a <hi>Kingdome</hi> purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt: and the time when this <hi>marriage</hi> was made was when Chriſt became man, who being the ſecond perſon of the bleſſed Trinity, was eſpouſed to his holy Church. So <hi>the King</hi> here mentioned is God the Father, ſending down his Son to be married to his ſaid Spouſe the holy Church.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The <hi>ſervants</hi> meant in this verſe were the Patriarks, and Prophets of the old Law, who could not prevail with the Jews to come unto the <hi>wedding feaſt</hi> that God had by theſe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants invited them unto.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The <hi>ſervants</hi> in this verſe were the Apoſtles, their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and all miſſionary Prieſts of the new Law of Chriſt. Theſe were bid tell the people invited, (and with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) the <hi>wedding feaſt</hi> was ready, for ſo the word <hi>dinner</hi> here imports. By the <hi>beeves, and fatlings</hi> are underſtood the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, Sacraments, Sermons, Martyrdomes, and all other ſpiritual food prepared for ſouls in holy Church.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. By theſe are underſtood men preferring the world before God, and ſo refuſing to be reconciled, for fear of looſing their eſtates by the penal lawes of man made againſt the followers of the Law of Chriſt. The <hi>farm,</hi> and <hi>merchandize</hi> are here ſet down in lieu of all other worldly occupations withdrawing ſoules from the ſervice of God.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Theſe are ſuch as did not onely refuſe themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come good, but proceeded farther in their malice by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing others in their way of vertue, in a word by perſecuting
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:204830:461"/> the people of God, the true Church of Chriſt. Such were thoſe who put to death the Apoſtles, ſuch they who now execute the Prieſts that ſucceed the Apoſtles in the miniſtery of Gods holy Word.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. This verſe tells us that God perceiving the wickedneſſe of thoſe who perſecuted his Saints, as the Jewes had done his ſacred Son, ſent <hi>in his wrath</hi> Titus, and Veſpaſian to deſtroy the Jewes, to ſack Jeruſalem, and therein to pull down the Temple of Solomon, the miracle in a manner of the world. So that the Princes Armies were the <hi>hoſtes</hi> in this verſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, who after they had ſackt, did burn the <hi>City</hi> of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</p>
                           <p n="8">8 This verſe alludes to the turning a way Gods face from the Jews, (his choſen people) and caſting his eye upon the Gentiles, which ſignifies the tranſmigration from the Jewiſh Synagogue, to the Church of Chriſt, from the old Law, to the new. And he ſayes truly, <hi>dinner was ready</hi> indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was then crucified; and yet after that, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, aſcenſion, and coming of the Holy Ghoſt, the ſtiffe-necked Jewes would nor be made believe in him; ſo then the Apoſtles were ſent from the unworthy Jewes to the Gentiles.</p>

                           <p n="10">10. This verſe alludes to the performance of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, when holy Church ſayes in honour of the Apoſtles, Rom. 10.18. The ſound of their lips went into every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>and even to the worlds end their words were heard,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting (as they were commanded) <hi>bad, and good;</hi> that is, not denying (as Reformiſts do) but that true faith may conſiſt with evill manners, that <hi>bad</hi> men may be yet true Chriſtians, or (which is all one) that in the Church of Chriſt there
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:204830:461"/> are ſinners as well as Saints, who are not therefore ſecluded the Church becauſe they are of evil life, but are ſtill exhorted to mend. By <hi>the marriage being filled with gueſts,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand here the Church of Chriſt was full of true <hi>believers</hi> of all Nations whatſoever.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. This verſe points at the day of Judgement, which is the laſt day of the nuptial feaſt of Jeſus Chriſt, when God coming to view <hi>his gueſts</hi> brought into the Church out of all Nations, ſhall eſpy one wanting his <hi>wedding garment,</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his robe of innocence, and ſanctity of life wrought by charity in his ſoul, and rendring his faith meritorious in the ſight of God by the good works of his charity. By this <hi>one</hi> is literally, and eminently here meant the reprobated Jew, who at the day of Judgment ſhall be more confounded then any other Nation whatſoever: ſo here is not had regard to <hi>faith</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>charity,</hi> ſince the onely obſtinate Jew is underſtood to have no faith at all, (how ever he come thither to receive his doom with others that are then to be judged) but his reprobation ſhall be ſignal, and remarkable when he ſhall be as it were the onely man picked out to be thruſt into the pit of hell. Though by <hi>one man</hi> mentioned here is alſo ſignified, that at the day of Judgment there ſhall not <hi>one</hi> be permitted to enter into the Kingdome of heaven who hath not on him the <hi>wedding garment</hi> of ſanctifying <hi>charity;</hi> hence, each one ought to have a great care leſt he be the <hi>one</hi> ſingled out to eternal perdition, ſince in that vaſte multitude not <hi>one</hi> can hope to lie hid from the ſight of the Judge.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. By being <hi>dumb</hi> is here underſtood not being able to alleadge any excuſe why he ſhould not be damned. Yet even in this inexcuſable delinquency the text by the word <hi>friend</hi> out of the <hi>King;</hi> mouth expreſſeth, it is purely our own faults we are not ſaved, for God on his part is our <hi>friend,</hi> and ſo calls us when we obſtinately perſiſt in profeſſing enmity to his Divine Majeſty.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. By the <hi>Waiters</hi> here we may not unfitly underſtand the divels, who <hi>wait</hi> indeed to ſnatch away as many ſoules
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:204830:462"/> to hell as they can. By the <hi>binding his hands and feet</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the ceſſation of all future action, and place is then onely left for paſſion, for enduring endleſſe torments. The <hi>darkneſſe</hi> of hell is therefore called <hi>utter darkneſſe,</hi> becauſe there is neither light of reaſon, nor of grace, nor place left in the damned to be ſaved by any meanes. Though S. Gregory calls it <hi>outward darkneſſe,</hi> which is more after the Latine text, becauſe it is a <hi>darkneſſe</hi> added to the <hi>darkneſſe</hi> of the heart, and ſoul wherein the damned creature lived, which, as contradiſtinguiſhed to that of hell, S. Gregory calls <hi>inward darkneſſe,</hi> where no light of grace did ſhine within the ſoul.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. This is a fearful concluſion; for whereas the parable ſpeaks but of <hi>one</hi> rejected, this verſe intimates very few are ſaved; that is, though <hi>many are called</hi> into the lap of the Church, yet but few are placed in the boſome of Chriſt, and there rewarded with eternal glory, namely, thoſe onely who by good works, and godly life added to their <hi>faith,</hi> have (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S. Peters counſel) <hi>made certain their vocation and election too,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. certain indeed to God, but not ſo to their knowledge, who at <hi>moſt</hi> can have but a certain hope thereof ſo long as they live.</p>

                           <p>WHat is remarkable in this Prayer is, the filial language of it to the heavenly Father; of whom we beg firſt that he will pleaſe to be <hi>pacified</hi> for the <hi>offences</hi> of his children, next that he will not onely <hi>pardon</hi> the ſaid <hi>offences,</hi> but further grant unto <hi>us</hi> the higheſt of all favours, his bleſſed <hi>peace,</hi> the ſame <hi>which ſurpaſſeth all underſtanding</hi> as we have heard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: and the reaſon why we are not content with <hi>pardon,</hi>
                              <pb n="295" facs="tcp:204830:463"/> unleſſe we have alſo the <hi>peace</hi> of conſcience to boot, (that which is never ſtruck up between God, and man without a kiſſe of love) the cloſe of this prayer tells us; becauſe as by <hi>pardon</hi> we are <hi>cleanſed</hi> from all offences, ſo by <hi>peace</hi> we are made able to ſerve his Divine Majeſty <hi>with ſecured ſouls.</hi> And of what are we ſecured? of his undoubted reconciliation to us by the kiſſe of love which ſealed a happy <hi>peace</hi> between us. Bleſſed JESU! how fond the holy Ghoſt is of us! that inſpires aged men to demean themſelves in their devotions like little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſitting in the laps of their loving parents: For ſuch is the language of this prayer, even as in a word or two we ſaid to God Almighty, Kiſſe, and be friends; for without a kiſſe of love it is impoſſible to hope for <hi>peace</hi> of conſcience to ſerve God, with ſouls <hi>ſecured</hi> that we are in his favour. But that this gloſſe may appear to be as congruous to the other ſervice of the day, as to the prayer above, ſee how by S. Paul the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks to us to day, as to little children, bidding us <hi>walk warily, and be wiſe, redeeming loſt time,</hi> and wiſely now leave to run after the rattles of our own inventions, and learn to underſtand <hi>what is the will of God,</hi> to forbear the rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous company of ſinners, and to converſe with Saints, thoſe that are not glutted with the wine of worldly pleaſures, but filled with the <hi>grace</hi> of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> which makes them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeak in other language then in <hi>pſalmes, hymnes,</hi> or <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual canticles, ſung in their hearts to our Lord God,</hi> or then in ſome <hi>thankeſgiving</hi> to him in the name <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that hath made us <hi>ſubject</hi> to one another <hi>without</hi> any other <hi>fear</hi> then of our Lord, and Saviour, from whom we are confident to obtain <hi>pardon</hi> of our ſins, teſtified with a pledge <hi>of peace</hi> given us by a kiſſe of love as often as we ſhall like dutiful chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren demand it. And if we take the Goſpel in that myſticall ſenſe wherein the Expoſitours do explicate the <hi>parable</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we ſhall find this gloſſe we have made to be hugely ſuitable thereunto. For the Expoſitours will have the ſoul of man to be the <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>little King</hi> who demands of her father Chriſt (the great King of heaven) <hi>cure of a ſick ſon,</hi> (a depraved will) and imployes all the ſenſes as ſo many <hi>ſervants</hi> ſent to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:204830:464"/> beg this cure, when the ſoul renounces the world, the fleſh, and the devil in holy baptiſme, and is by that Sacrament as by a <hi>touch</hi> of the virtue of our Saviour <hi>cured of her ague,</hi> her inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate deſires, and appetites, and this at the <hi>ſeventh hour,</hi> that is to ſay, by the ſeven-fold healing Spirit of the holy Ghoſt, we ſhall then ſee this prayer is penned in a language ſpeaking (though in other tearm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>) the very ſenſe of this Goſpel too. For what doth the <hi>pardon</hi> begged in the prayer allude unto but original ſin? remitted by holy baptiſme, and actual ſin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given by the Sacrament of penance; and to the pledge of <hi>peace</hi> ſealed with the kiſſe of love, when by the Sacrament of the holy Euchariſt we ſee our ſelves not onely ſet as it were like darlings in the lap of Chriſt, but even the bleſſed Trinity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to dwell in our hearts <hi>cleanſed,</hi> as above, <hi>from all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> and ſerving God with <hi>ſecured ſoules</hi> that then all is well between us, and our heavenly Father, when in teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thereof his Divine Majeſtie makes our ſoul here his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral throne, that we may hope to have his boſome our eternal tabernacle in the world to come. And thus we ſee how particularly this Prayer is grounded on the other ſervice of the day, what ever common place of piety it ſeems to be to thoſe that will not ſtudy the ſpecial myſterie thereof.</p>

                           <p n="15">15. THe Apoſtle here ſpeaks to the Epheſians out of the abundance of his care, when he bids them <hi>ſee how they walked,</hi> as if the leaſt trip in them (now they had ſo clear a day, ſo bright a ſun-ſhine to <hi>walk in</hi> as is that of the Goſpel) were unſufferable, in regard <hi>the word</hi> of God was like a <hi>lanthorn to their footing,</hi> Pſal. 118.105. ſhewing them where they might fix everyſtep ſecurely; and <hi>walk</hi> (converſe) <hi>warily,</hi> as if they were to <hi>render an account</hi> not onely for every idle action, <hi>but for every idle word,</hi> Mat. 12.36. ſince they had the honour to be inſtructed by Jeſus Chriſt, the wiſdome of the eternal Father, how to lead their lives here ſo religiouſly wary, as that they need not fear to live eternally happy in the next world. And not to do this, S. Paul here tels them is folly, and they that do ſo are <hi>not wiſe,</hi> but fools to waſt away that precious time in idleneſſe, which was given them to work out their ſalvation in with fear and trembling, leſt by looſing any part of the time allotted them for this end, they might by ſudden death be prevented in that very loſſe of time they made, and ſo with the fooliſh virgins be ſhut out of heaven as not ready, nor fit to enter in when the Bridegroom comes by, with whom (or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) they muſt be admitted in.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. And that the Apoſtle in the verſe above intimated their regard to a good uſe of <hi>time</hi> in their converſations, this verſe reſtifies, bidding them not onely have a care to ſpend the <hi>time</hi> preſent, and to come religiouſly, but even to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the time paſt</hi> which they had miſſpent; or elſe it needed not to be <hi>redeemed,</hi> but that he did account it quite loſt unto
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:204830:465"/> them who had not ſpent it well. Now the beſt way to <hi>redeem</hi> paſt <hi>time</hi> ill ſpent, is to be ſure that every inſtant of time be not onely well imployed, but that in it (over and above) ſome good deed be ſuperadded more then rigorouſly we are bound unto, with intention to <hi>redeem</hi> time paſt thereby; and this may be done by prayers, mortification, almes, contrition, and tears, laid down upon the account of miſſpent <hi>time</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: ſo that as we ſecure every inſtant of preſent <hi>time</hi> by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good all the while it flowes away from us, we ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe redeem our loſt time paſt, if we produce an act of ſorrow for it, and let our repentance for not having done well hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accompany our well doing for the preſent. Note, the <hi>dayes</hi> are not ſaid <hi>to be evil,</hi> that there is any malice, or iniquity intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal to time; (which is no other thing then the ſuns motion, and this we may call the meaſure of al other movings) but that the malice of an evil action, which takes up <hi>time</hi> whilſt it is in doing, is of ſo malignant a nature in the ſight of God, that it renders the doer of it (and the <hi>time</hi> wherein 'tis done) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull to his divine Majeſty; and conſequently, as that man is evil who doth ill, ſo that <hi>time</hi> is accounted evil alſo which is ſpent in evil doing: and ſince <hi>there is no man that doeth good,</hi> (of himſelf) <hi>no not one</hi> Pſ. 13.3. therefore the Apoſtle reflecting on what we do of our ſelves, ſayes abſolutely, <hi>the dayes are evil:</hi> (are rendred ſuch by our evil deeds) And that they may be good he exhorts us in the following verſe</p>
                           <p n="17">17. That we <hi>become not unwiſe,</hi> in waſting time by following our own imaginations, but <hi>wiſe,</hi> in ſtudying to <hi>underſtand what is the will of God;</hi> namely, to ſpend our <hi>time</hi> in acts of virtue, not in idleneſſe, or ſinfull courſes.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. And for inſtance that this was his true meaning, the Apoſtle gives us warning above all others of that idleneſſe, and wicked courſe of life which <hi>drunkards</hi> ſpend their <hi>time</hi> in, who ſeem to drink off their own damnation by every cup of drink they take in any notable exceſſe; or as if they did begin a health to the devil, and he (to pledge them) ſwallowed the drinkers of his health up into the pit of hell. This ſeem to be affirmed by the inſtance of the effect that follows drunkenneſs,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:204830:465"/> or rather by the deſcription of it what it is, when S. Paul ſaies it includes <hi>riotouſneſſe</hi> in it ſelf, it expoſeth men to all ſort of ſin; and we know whither the great maſter of <hi>Ryots, Dives</hi> went, immediately to hell, ſo do all his followers that die guiltie of that ſoul-ſwallowing-ſin of drunkenneſſe; for few there are who once give way to this abſorbing vice that ever leave it off, becauſe it brings them to wantonneſſe, quarrels, and what not beſides? ſo conſequently great is the danger of it; and therefore the Apoſtle names it here, as the greateſt, or one notorious miſ-ſpending of time principally to be avoided by Chriſtians: But if your thirſt be ſuch as you muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be quenching of it, and ſo endanger being drunk, loe S. Paul gives you a ſafe, and lawful cup whereof he allowes you to drink your fill, <hi>the cup of ſpirit;</hi> not of material li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quours, but ſuch as the Apoſtles <hi>drank</hi> when their hearers thought them drunk, Act. 2.13, 14. though they were not ſo, ſave onely that by the plenitude of the holy Ghoſt, of the cup of grace, they did ſeeme to be like drunken men.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. Alwaies talking, both in Church, and houſe, at home, and abroad of the Almighty God of heaven, or of heavenly things, as if the wine of grace had ſet our tongues a running, ſo as we could not hold our peaces; and yet to ſhew what cup it was we were filled with, our talk ought to be ſpiritual, even <hi>ſinging,</hi> as commonly drunkards do, but differently from them <hi>ſpiritual hymnes, and canticles</hi> praiſing Almighty God for our ſpiritual inebriation; and this even <hi>in our hearts,</hi> as the Apoſtle adviſeth, which argues our heads are not to be full of drink, but our hearts full of love, that is our ſoules full of grace. So here we ſee the difference between brutiſh, and ſpiritual drunkards; the one is feeding full, the other faſting; the one prating, the other preaching; the one how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the other ſinging; the one wallowing in the mire of ſin, the other ſwimming in the ſea of grace; and ſee one more admirable difference, that even while our tongues are ſilent, our hearts and ſoules are ſinging the praiſes of Almighty God when they are <hi>drunk in ſpirit.</hi> This the Apoſtle ſaies in plain tearmes while he bids the Epheſians (and in them
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:204830:466"/> us Chriſtians) <hi>ſing in our hearts;</hi> which may be done not onely while we hold our peaces, but while we waking pray mentally, nay, while we ſleep, or (which is more) while we are extatically rapt in a deep contemplation, more benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our outward ſenſes then ſoundeſt ſleep can do: and in ſuch a circumſtance was S. Paul himſelf when he was rapt to the third heavens, and ſaid of himſelf, he knew not whether his ſoul were in, or out of his body, 2 Cor. 12.2. but well he knew that his heart was ſinging praiſe and glory to his Lord, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to Almighty God. And the beſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of our being thus ſpiritually drunk is, when we are alwayes chearfull in our countenances, and ſpeeches, whatſoere befall us in our perſons, ſickneſs or health, peace or perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, favour or frowns of Princes, or the like.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. <hi>Giving God the Father alwayes thanks for all in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> good or bad that ſhall betide our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; that is to ſay, taking good as encouragements to deſerve better, bad as puniſhments to terrifie us from continuing to do ill. And while the Apoſtle bids us live <hi>alwayes giving God the Father thanks in his Sons Name,</hi> (who gave him the beſt) be alludes unto the double title by which God requires theſe continual <hi>thanks</hi> at our hands; firſt, as he is God, and Maſter of all goodneſs; ſecondly, as he is our <hi>Father,</hi> inceſſantly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting part of his inexhauſtible goodneſs unto us.</p>

                           <p n="46">46. SAint Irenaeus will have the Centurion, of whom Saint Matthew ſpeaks in his eighth Chapter, to be <hi>this Lord</hi> whom here Saint John mentions; but it is more probable to be another, becauſe that Centurion did believe by the motive of this precedent cure, and ſeeing Chriſt ready to go to his ſervant, ſtopt him, and ſaid, he needed not give himſelf the trouble of that labour, but it would ſuffice if he did command the cure by a word of his mouth, Matth. 8.8. whereas this Lord preſſeth Chriſt to go: Again, that Centurion asked the cure of a Palſie; <hi>this Lord,</hi> of a Feaver: That Chriſt going, (and almoſt coming near him) cured; this he did not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, nor ſtir towards. Hence this muſt needs be a different cure from that, and was indeed precedent to it, as we ſaid above.</p>
                           <p n="47">47. Note <hi>this Lord</hi> went from <hi>Capharnaam</hi> to Cana in Galilee fourteen Leagues off, out of the fame he had heard of Chriſt his great cures; but not believing this was done by any other then humane means, he asked him rather as a famous Doctour, then as otherwiſe qualified, to come unto his ſon, and cure him; or if he did believe he could cure by touching the diſeaſed, yet he did not believe the touch of his vertue was ſufficient, unleſs he added thereunto the touch of his perſon, ſo he preſſed him to go perſonally to his ſon.</p>
                           <p n="48">48. Be the opinion of the <hi>Lord</hi> what it will concerning Chriſt his power, whether as Doctour, or as God that he did his cures, certain it is Chriſt his meaning was to bring men by the fame of his works to believe in his Deity, and therefore he replies to this <hi>Lord,</hi> as if he muſt have <hi>ſignes,</hi> and <hi>wonders</hi> done to work belief into him. Note, that <hi>ſignes,</hi> and <hi>wonders</hi> thus differ: the firſt are properly done in, and by nature, gently operating, as curing diſeaſes which need not any power above nature; the ſecond is commonly miraculous, and is therefore done by a power exceeding natures force; of this ſort is raiſing the dead: So by <hi>wonders</hi> here are underſtood
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:204830:468"/> miracles, and all little enough to make the Jews believe.</p>
                           <p n="49">49. It ſeems by this reply the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhewed himſelf to be rather of the Jewiſh then of the Samaritan (that is of the Gentiles) race, for you ſee he believes in no virtual, but will have an actual touch to cure his ſon, leſt he die for want of ſuch a touch; and no Nation ſo hard of belief as the Jewiſh.</p>
                           <p n="50">50. O ſtrange clemency in our Saviour! he rebukes no more, but by yielding to humane infirmity confirms this <hi>Lord</hi> in the belief of his Deity; for the more he doubted of Chriſt his power to be able (at a diſtance) to cure his ſon, the more he muſt admire to ſee it done at the ſame diſtance, and the more he admires at the thing done, the better he thinks of the power doing it, and the ſtronger is his faith in him that gives teſtimony of ſuch a power. Lo, by this art our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts this Infidel, by doing at a diſtance what the other thought was impoſſible ſo to be done: whereupon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſayes to him, <hi>Go, thy ſon liveth;</hi> that is as much as to ſay, he is cured, and ſhall live. Now though this <hi>Lord</hi> did not ſufficiently believe in Chriſt his diſtantial operative virtue, yet he nothing doubted of his preſential veracity, but firmly believed what he ſaid or promiſed here, would undoubtedly be verified, and made good there where his ſon was: Hence the Text ſayes, he <hi>believed,</hi> and went to enjoy the hopes of his belief by finding him well; for the words of our Saviour were not onely affirmative, or enunciative, but operative too, that is, did effect the thing they declared to be done, and this effect the <hi>Lord</hi> did confidently believe. So by this means Chriſt wrought two miracles, one in curing the corporal ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſon, the other in curing the ſpiritual diſeaſe of the father his infidelity: and it may not be wide of the ſenſe to ſay the later cure prevailed to obtein the firſt; for it ſeems the child proved well juſt at the time the father did believe he ſhould find him ſo when he came home.</p>
                           <p n="51">51. 52. Theſe two verſes ſeem to tell us onely (for they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port little elſe beſides) this remarkable ſign of Gods goodneſſe, to prevent the father in the ſatisfaction he expected, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:204830:469"/> his ſervants ſhould meet him, and give him the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty thereof, and thereby the reward of his belief ſoone then he did expect it, which was not before he had ſeen his ſon well at home; but now he finds it is true ere he gate unto his houſe, much leſſe unto his ſon, for it ſeems they were come the day before from home (ſince they told him he was yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day recovered) to meet their maſter with this gladſome ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of his ſons recovery. Yes indeed, God is ſo good he rather anticipates, then protracts his ſervants rewards when they do well.</p>
                           <p n="53">53. The reaſon why the exact hour of the childs recovery was enquired after by the father, was to ſatisfie his family, as well as himſelf, that this was a miraculous, and not a natural cure; ſince the child lying at the point of death, was proved to recover juſt at the inſtant wherein our Saviour ſaid he <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> or (which is here all one) that he was well: for it was proper enough to ſpeak this later by the former words, ſince the father had told our Saviour <hi>his ſon began to dye,</hi> (was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally agonizing, or dying) whereupon Chriſt told him <hi>he did live,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, there was not in him any danger of death. And ſince this danger was prevented by the virtue onely of a word out of our Saviours mouth, ſpoken at that minute when it was doubted whether he were dead or alive, (ſo dangerous a caſe he was in) thoſe who heard of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious alteration upon the meer, and ſole prolation of a word were immediately converted, and became as faithful believers in our Saviours Deity as their <hi>Lord, and Maſter</hi> was; ſo every way is it true that <hi>God his works are abſolutely perfect,</hi> Deut. 32. v. 4. ſince here we ſee by the force of one onely word of God, the father, ſon, and <hi>all the family</hi> became of Jewes, good Chriſtians, and doubtleſſe ſo continued, and ſo dyed, having the ſame their converter who was their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and who queſtionleſſe converted them to ſave them all. To conclude, if we will underſtand this ſtory myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may conceive this <hi>Lord</hi> to be the ſoul of man, called <hi>little King,</hi> as being allied to the King of heaven; his ſick ſon to be his depraved will; his ſervants his corporeal ſenſes;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:204830:469"/> his ague his inordinate appetites, or deſires. This ſoul ſick, as above, is cured by Chriſt in holy baptiſme, and made of a petty King, of an heir to the world, a great King indeed, an heir to the Kingdome of heaven; her cure is ſaid to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the <hi>ſeventh hour,</hi> becauſe the number ſeven is a type of the Sabbath, or day of reſt, or of the ſeven-fold healing Spirit of God, the Holy Ghoſt conveyed into our ſoules by the ſeven Sacraments, while in them his holy grace is beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us, or of the number ſeven divided into three, and four, betokening the myſtery of the ſacred Trinity diſperſed into, and reigning over all the four corners of the world, Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South.</p>

Since therefore we are bid in the Epiſtle <hi>walk warily,</hi> this Goſpel doth fitly ſecure our footing by the firmneſſe of our <hi>faith</hi> required to our <hi>wary walking;</hi> for indeed <hi>charity</hi> can no longer ſtand faſt then ſhe is ſupported by the root of firmeſt <hi>faith:</hi> and we have divers places in holy Writ that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate this doctrine to us, as when we are told Rom. 10.
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:204830:470"/> 
                              <hi>The heart believes to justification but the mouth to ſalvation,</hi> ſo that the profeſſion of our <hi>faith</hi> is requiſite to ſhew the perfection of it: Again, Matth. 14. v. 31. our Saviour himſelf rebuked thoſe of <hi>little faith</hi> as unpleaſing to him. So the Church, to prevent theſe defects in us, ſeems to day to exact a teſtimony of all our other vertues by the perfection of our <hi>faith,</hi> as if the root of all defects in Chriſtianity were the want of ſolidity in faith.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And we may piouſly perſwade our ſelves, that upon the ſole account of our perfection in this one vertue, the Church builds her confidence to ask (this once at leaſt) <hi>pardon</hi> for all her ſins whatſoever; the rather becauſe ſhe ſees that many evill livers have gone away renowned hence with the Crown of Martyrdome, in recompence of their firm and lively <hi>faith,</hi> which ever involves an <hi>act of charity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Whereupon our holy Mother prayes to day, as above, that her perfect <hi>believers</hi> may have <hi>pardon</hi> of their ſin, and with a <hi>ſecurity of mind</hi> may ſerve God <hi>quietly in works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>

                           <p>IT imports not whether we underſtand by <hi>piety</hi> in this prayer Almighty God his pitty towards us, or our devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards him, for either way the ſenſe is good: ſince if God be alwayes taking pity of us, certainly he will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe us ſuch meanes as may afford us the fruits of his pity, that is, our relief, or eaſe; and if we imploy our ſelves in a <hi>continual piety</hi> towards him, we may reſt aſſured, in lieu of that continued devotion, to obtain his help in all our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, and to find that, he <hi>protecting us,</hi> we ſhall be both <hi>free from all adverſity,</hi> and <hi>reſt in good works devoted to his name</hi> with that <hi>continual piety</hi> which here we do petition. But it will be requiſite, for our adjuſting this Prayer to the other ſervice of the day, to know what <hi>protection</hi> it is which will be ſo efficacious as to free us from all <hi>adverſity,</hi> and <hi>to devote us ſtill unto good works done in the name of God;</hi> nor can thoſe be truly good works which are done in any other name: And S. Paul in this Epiſtle informs us that this <hi>protection</hi> is the <hi>grace</hi> of God, <hi>which doth ſtrengthen us in our Lord, and in the might of his power,</hi> that being an <hi>armour</hi> able to defend us <hi>againſt all the deceits of the devil;</hi> in brief, it is that <hi>grace</hi> which
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:204830:471"/> 
                              <hi>girts our loynes with truth,</hi> and cloathes <hi>us with the brest-plate of juſtice,</hi> which brings along with it <hi>the ſhield of faith,</hi> the <hi>helmet of hope,</hi> the <hi>ſword of the Spirit,</hi> or the Word of God wherewith we vanquiſh all the enemies we have, <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Potentates, Rectours,</hi> or what other ſo ere they be that hell it ſelf can iſſue out againſt us. And if we call this <hi>grace</hi> the <hi>continual piety</hi> of Almighty God towards us we ſhall not ſpeak amiſſe, for it is that <hi>piety</hi> indeed which is our <hi>protection from all adverſity,</hi> and which abundantly ſerves us to all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in this Epiſtle ſpecified. As for the Goſpel it being <hi>parabolical,</hi> no mervail the cloſe of this prayer exhauſts it in a myſterious language, namely that of our being <hi>devoted to the name of God in good works:</hi> For in very truth the whole <hi>parable</hi> is epitomized, or ſummed up in this, that as we hope God ſhould be <hi>good</hi> to us, ſo we muſt be <hi>good</hi> to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; as we hope God ſhould have <hi>pity</hi> on us, and out of that <hi>pity</hi> furniſh us with the <hi>protection</hi> of his holy grace, ſo we muſt have pity of one another, and do to every body as we deſire God ſhould do to us. Now ſince all that comes from God to his creatures is his goodneſſe poured out upon them, and ſo juſtly called his <hi>good deeds</hi> to us, therefore we moſt properly cloſe this prayer with an acknowledgment that the grace of God is that which <hi>devotes us to his holy name,</hi> and which for honour to his Divine Majeſty makes us do good to our neighbours, imploy our ſelves, and our abilities in <hi>good works</hi> done to them. And certainly while we are loving one to another, we are <hi>devoted to Almighty God,</hi> in regard it is, and ought to be for Chriſt his ſake, and for devotion to him, and to his name that we do good to Chriſtians: and we have ſufficient motive in the cloſe of this Goſpel for our doing <hi>good works,</hi> ſince we ſee the penalty of omitting them in him that was caſt into eternal miſery for want of doing <hi>one act of mercy</hi> to his neighbour. And thus ſtill we ſee the aſſerted connexion between all the parts of holy Churches ſervices made good in each particular thereof, by a conſtant relation from one unto the other.</p>

                           <p n="11">11. By the <hi>armour of God</hi> is here underſtood his holy grace, which is unto us a compleat <hi>armour,</hi> indeed from head to foot, not onely of Piſtol, or Musket, but even of Cannon proof; for ſo it is underſtood when it is ſaid to be againſt <hi>all the deceits of the devil,</hi> his leaſt, his greater, and his greateſt of all, even thoſe that like thunder-bolts of moſt horrid temptations play about our ears much louder then the voices of Canons do, or can; becauſe againſt theſe (be we never ſo often, never ſo long battered, or ſtormed by them) the grace of God is proof enough, not onely to bear off firſt all the play of the Devils artillery againſt us, but afterwards to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with powder, and ball ſufficient to batter down all our enemies ſtrongeſt holds, to force his trenches, and chacing him from thence to render us abſolutely maſters of the field, and conquerours over all our enemies that either the world, the fleſh, the devil, or all Hell it ſelf can iſſue out againſt us; for as Saint Bernard ſaith, <q>The devils temptations are not ſo powerfull over us, as our prayer is over him, his pride can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lay us ſo low as our humility will proſtrate him.</q>

                           <p n="12">12. This Verſe is not ſo affrighting as it is friendly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming us whom we are to fight againſt, not onely <hi>fleſh and bloud,</hi> for they are yet weaker then our own reaſon, how ever
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:204830:472"/> for want of uſing the <hi>imperium,</hi> or abſolute command of our ſouls over our own bodies we are miſerably betraid, and made a prey to our own mutinous fleſhly members; but we have yet ſtronger enemies to encounter with, and fit it is we ſhould know them, for which cauſe the Apoſtle here rangeth them into battail array, calling them <hi>Princes, Potentates, &amp;c.</hi> By <hi>Princes</hi> are here underſtood thoſe devils who were of that rank and order of Angels before they fell, whom Saint Paul calleth <hi>Principalities:</hi> by <hi>Potentates</hi> thoſe whom he calls <hi>Powers,</hi> which rank they yet reſerve in Hell, and ſo command the inferiour Orders of Devils to act their pleaſures, even as we ſee Rebels to their lawfull Prince content to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of him they chuſe for their Maſter Rebell, which in Hell is <hi>Lucifer</hi> the Archangel, and under him ſome of all the nine Quires of Angels who fell into the firſt Rebellion with him. And namely by the <hi>Rectours</hi> here ſpecifide, the Apoſtle ſeems to allude unto theſe Apoſtatical Fiends who were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called by him the <hi>Dominations,</hi> for theſe had a kinde of dominion ſpecial to them in Heaven over the children of God, and now ſuch of them as are fallen have the ſame dominion over the children of the Devil, for theſe be they who make up <hi>the world of this darkneſs,</hi> not onely of ſin, but of all the effects thereof, War, Plague, Famine: And theſe <hi>Rectours</hi> are commonly conceived to be the aerial Divels who cauſe all ſtorms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the air, all temptations, and troubles in mens ſouls; and hence it is Saint Paul cals them the <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of wickedneſs in the celeſtials,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>aerial</hi> devils towring like Hawks in the air over the prey of our ſouls. By the <hi>Spirituals of wickedneſs</hi> is meant the wickedneſſe of theſe ſpirits who have no limit of their malice, tormenting not onely our bodies but our ſouls; which laſt is expreſſed by the Apoſtle, ſaying, they attach us <hi>in the celestials,</hi> in thoſe points which concern our ſouls, being ſpirits created, and ordained for heaven, and to eternal glory there, and are perpetually by theſe aerial devils ſeiſed on by their ſharpeſt talons of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whenſoever they make the leaſt attempt of an aſpiring, or mount to heaven, unleſſe the impulſe of grace be ſuch as
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:204830:473"/> renders them more able to riſe upon their ſpirituall wings, then theſe aeriall devils are to keep them down, which is ever when to ſufficient (never failing the true children of God) they obtein the addition of effectuall grace, ſeldome given <hi>gratis</hi> without our extraordinary cooperation towards obtein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. Now that we ſee that we have no unarmed enemies to encounter, the Apoſtle bids us again take up, <hi>and ſtand to our armes,</hi> the grace of God, (which alone ſufficeth, and is proof enough) that <hi>we may reſist in the evil day,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in the hour of temptations, that being the greateſt of <hi>evils,</hi> for by this <hi>evil</hi> it is that we are plunged into all the reſt; though our reſiſting temptation will not make the day ſo good wherein we do reſiſt it, but that there will come a period of that day which will <hi>be evill</hi> to us again, namely, the day of judgement, wherein the devill will pretend ſome guilt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent amidſt our beſt reſiſtances, yet in vain, by <hi>Gods grace;</hi> for if we ſecure our ſelves from mortall ſin in the <hi>evill day</hi> of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, we ſhall not need to fear his malice in the day of publication, when he will lay open all our faults againſt us in hope thereby to make it the day of our eternall damnation. By the cloſe of this verſe we are not onely counſelled to reſiſt temptation, but to keep the field after the battail wonne; for thus much imports the counſell of the Apoſtle bidding us <hi>ſtand in all things perfect,</hi> meaning there to fortifie, and plant our ſelves in virtue where we were by vice attached.</p>
                           <p n="14">14. By this verſe we are told, <hi>truth</hi> muſt be the ground of all our warre, and that we muſt be ſure our cauſe of fight be <hi>juſt</hi> beſides, and the juſtice of it is <hi>our breast plate;</hi> for thoſe are the two buckles that muſt <hi>gird our loyns,</hi> (which is to ſay, ſtrengthen our cauſe;) and beeing ſo girt we need never fear the hotteſt fury of moſt fierce aſſaults, but ſhall be better accoutered for our ſpiritual fight then ſouldiers are to the warrs, who have their ſcarfes, or belts about them of ſilk, gold, or ſilver to adorn them with, in teſtimony of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, reſolution, and affection in, and to their cauſe.</p>
                           <p n="15">15. By <hi>being ſhod</hi> is here intimated the difference between
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:204830:473"/> the Evangelicall and the Old Law: for in the Old Law all ſervants as well as ſlaves went barefooted; and to foretell the captivitie of the Egyptians, who were by the Aſſyrians led barefoot in ſhew of their ſlavery, Iſaias went three dayes barefooted, Iſa. 20.3.4. which he needed not have done but for this propheticall end; whereas the Apoſtle intimates here our ſlavery is paſt, and our ſervitude alſo, in regard we are of ſlaves to the devil made now children of God, and ſo need go no longer barefooted. But the trueſt meaning of this place is, that by being <hi>ſhod</hi> we ſhew a promptitude both in hearing, preaching, and practiſing the Word of God; as who ſhould ſay, this promptitude were the beſt preparation to bring in Chriſtianitie to all parts of the world. And the Goſpel of Chriſt is rightly called a <hi>Goſpel of peace,</hi> becauſe it brings tidings of humane redemption, of fraternall dilection, and of ſalvation to thoſe that walk therein.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. <hi>In all things</hi> imports here above all things, that we muſt take up the <hi>ſhield of true faith,</hi> for that is it indeed which not onely ſhews us to be Chriſtians, but defends us againſt all enemies of Chriſt, by breaking the darts, and arrows of the devil which are ſhot againſt us, and are born off by this buckler of <hi>faith,</hi> are received confidently, and ſhattered againſt it aſſuredly; for no temptations enter the body, or the ſoul that are received upon this buckler. By the <hi>fierie darts of the moſt wicked one,</hi> are underſtood the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of the fleſh which the devil leads us into; and ſuch are thoſe of burning luſt, but eaſily quenched by believing God's grace is ſufficient to extinguiſh them in us, as it was in S. Paul 2 Cor. 12. v. 9.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. By the head-peice, or <hi>helmet</hi> of ſalvation the Apoſtle means <hi>the hope of heaven</hi> given us by Chriſt his paſſion; for as a <hi>helmet</hi> ſecures the head as the chief part of man, ſo this <hi>hope</hi> of heaven ſettles all our thoughts, rectifies our intentions, and ſquares our actions to the right end that makes them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and encourageth us (for the <hi>hope</hi> we have of heaven) to ruſh in upon any danger which is between vs, and that bleſſed home, as men whoſe heads are armed with a <hi>helmet</hi> do break
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:204830:474"/> into the thickeſt ſhower of their enemies darts or ſwords.

The Explication above hath fitted us to the fight, and taught us the uſe of our armes.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Now Charity</hi> defend thy ſelf and us, put up thy Royal ſtandard, that of Heavenly Grace fixt to the Croſs of Chriſt: See how they charge thee on thy right wing firſt, hark how their canons roar againſt <hi>thy Faith,</hi> while it is Deity indeed they fight againſt, with Infidelitie, Atheiſtry, Paganiſme, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:204830:474"/> Hereſie, Judaiſme, Sects and Schiſmes as many as there are fancies in mens fickle brains. See at the ſame time how they charge thy left wing too, <hi>Thy hope</hi> of everaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſſe. This they would fool thee out of by their onely facing thee with Liberty, (thy birth-right) with honour, pleaſure, profit, treaſure, and command; poſſeſſions better (as they ſay) then thy beſt of expectations ought to fright thee from. But all the main charge is againſt <hi>thy Faith,</hi> and this too given by the Captain-General, <hi>the ſpiritual of wickedneſs in the celeſtials;</hi> he that having loſt himſelf would loſe thee too; he that's aſham'd thou ſhould'ſt enjoy the happineſſe he is deprived of, becauſe <hi>he could not love</hi> his Maker better then himſelf. See then the Battail's at an end; if <hi>charity</hi> can love, God can crown her with the victory over him that loſt the day for lack of <hi>love.</hi> Be ſure thy faith can never fail if thou be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in thy love; ſince all belief is rooted in charity: ſo we are taught Epheſ. 3.18. <hi>Whileſt we have Chriſt to dwell in our hearts by faith, rooted and founded in charity;</hi> the ſame is of the Deity, and all the other myſteries of <hi>Faith</hi> we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and all of <hi>Hope.</hi> So whileſt our <hi>charity</hi> keeps her Body cloſe, her virtues round about her, (thoſe we call <hi>the works of love</hi>) her wings are ſafe, the day, the field's her own, maugre all the enemies aſſaults: for ſay, beloved, though we ſhould admit (which yet we muſt not do) that Inviſibles are ſlender motives to make us relinquiſh all the preſent pleaſures of the world, yet of the two Inviſibles, thoſe that tie us up to goodneſs here, are ſafer certainly then thoſe that let us looſe to all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So by force of reaſon <hi>charity</hi> hath woon the day, while ſhe <hi>believes, hopes</hi> in, and <hi>loves</hi> the unſeen Deity, by having ſeen the ſayntity of his ſacred Son: and in <hi>that faith, that hope, that love,</hi> defies the unſeen enemy to Deity the Devil, whoſe ſeen iniquities affright us from the ruine he invites us to.</p>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:204830:476"/> of Heaven,</hi> as the courſe of it is here deſcribed in this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>

                           <p n="24">24. By the number of <hi>ten thouſand talents</hi> of money <hi>owing</hi> from the Servant to the Maſter, is here aſſigned a certain, for an uncertain Debt, or indeed a finite, for an infinite; namely, a mortal ſin againſt Almighty God, which how ever finite in the act is infinite in the malice, becauſe committed againſt an infinite Goodneſſe. So that by deadly ſin a man becomes debtour to God, and ſtands bound to repay him all the Gifts, Virtues, and Graces infuſed into his Soul by holy Baptiſme, and ſquandered away by any one deadly ſin: ſo the debt is of the treaſure of Heaven, the grace of the holy Ghoſt; ſpent by a ſinner, which God truſted him with, and which by ſin he hath waſted.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. By this command to <hi>ſell</hi> the non-ſolvent debtour, as alſo <hi>his wife, children, and all the</hi> goods he hath, is intimated, that for any one mortal ſin a man, and all that is dear unto him is confiſcate to Almighty God, and ought to be <hi>ſold;</hi> (to be caſt into eternal pains) and ſo though this be nothing towards repayment of the debt, yet ſince he had ſold grace, Heaven, God and all for ſin, now by right God ſhould ſell his ſin, body, ſoul and all to the devil, though ſtill his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (as long as man lives) reſerves a place for repentance, ſuch as in the following verſe we find. Note here, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularizing to ſell <hi>wife, and children,</hi> adds nothing to the myſtery more then to ſhow man looſeth himſelf, and all that is dear unto him by ſin.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. Alas! what can poor man afford towards the repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo great a treaſure when 'tis waſted by him?

                           <p n="27">27. This verſe proves the former to be explicated in a right ſenſe, ſo it needs no more enlargement.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. This verſe beſides the ingratitude it ſhowes in man to God, not forgiving his brother (Gods image) as himſelf was forgiven; ſo again it ſhowes the narrowneſſe of mans heart, and the largeneſſe of Gods, one forgiving an infinite debt being but asked ſo to do, the other not remitting a petty one by any entreaty whatſoever.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. Strange that we cannot kneel with humble heart to God but he relents, and yet to man no bow of knee, or heart prevailes. Note here, <hi>patience,</hi> or forbearance of the debt was truly, and properly demanded upon promiſe, and juſt hope of payment after a while, becauſe it is not out of mans power to pay man what is due unto him, though 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we can hope to make even ſcores with God, unleſſe he rather remit, then demand the debt. So the <hi>patience</hi> asked by the ſervant of his Lord was rather an artifice to gain time, hoping by intervention of Friends rather to get the debt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, then that there was any likelihood of this ſervants payment of it, what fair promiſes ſo ever he made in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of his being preſſed, becauſe that was a debt from a creature to God; but this is onely a debt between man and man, ſo here to delay was not to delude, or elude the debt; and conſidering it was asked of him for a little ſumm, who had before obtained remiſſion of an infinite great one, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the debt ought by all means to have been forborn, if not forgiven.</p>
                           <p n="30">30. Here we ſee how true it is that the rigour of the law, is higheſt injury. This man did but uſe the rigour of the law, yet he had before a pattern ſet him o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But by this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed, how unchriſtian a thing it is in us to beg abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our own deadly ſinnes to God by means of confeſſion, and yet to refuſe a pardon to thoſe men that do but ſlightly offend us.</p>
                           <p n="31">31. This verſe rather tells what infirmity is in man to man on earth, then that we can think the Saints or Angels runne officiouſly to God, and provoke him to take notice of our ſinnes, rather then begge him to turn his face away from them, or to caſt them at leaſt behind him, that (if it were poſſible) he might not ſee them. So here the ſtory is rather told to make it flow currantly as an act between man and man, then as a true expreſſion of the thing figured in the ſtory.</p>

                           <p n="33">33. 34. This wrath is juſt, and ſo not to be wondred at. By the <hi>tormenters</hi> here are underſtood the devils: By <hi>lying till the debt be paid,</hi> is to ſay, eternally; becauſe no <hi>torment</hi> is puniſhment enough for mortall ſinne which is of infinite malice, and which malice continues eternally if man unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately dy in deadly ſinne; ſo no marvell his pain be eternall, when the duration of the malice is without end. All the doubt is here, whether a ſinne once forgiven by God can be recalled, and man be damned for it as if he never had been forgiven; ſo this ſtory imports. But the true ſenſe of this place is, that by this example was preſented ſo great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude that it became a mortall ſinne, and conſequently (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving damnation) it did as good as bring back all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly remitted debt of ſinne, ſince to be damned for one only, or for many ſinns imports a deſert of equall torments exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, though not intenſive, that is to ſay, of as long, though not as cruel, or as bitter pains. But to the thing intended by this <hi>Parable,</hi> which is the obligation we have under pain of damnation to forgive our neighbour if we will hope to have God forgive us, the ſtory runnes right enough, even in the rigour of the words, ſo it needs the leſſe gloſſing.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. AS this Goſpell we ſee is <hi>parabolicall,</hi> ſo is it applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at pleaſure to the beſt of piety we can cull out of it. Wherefore not to recapitulate what the Illuſtration, or Explication above have told us already, we ſhall do well to perſwade our ſelves, this own example of <hi>Ingratitude</hi> in our <hi>wicked</hi> fellow <hi>ſervant</hi> ought to be a motive to us of practiſing the contrary virtue; not onely towards our common maſter who is ever obliging us, but alſo towards our fellow ſervants who can never diſoblige us, if we remember that <hi>all the hurt we receive is from our ſelves.</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. And again, this Goſpell minding us how the evil of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude</hi> was puniſhed, is therefore fitly placed after an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of ſo much evil intended us, (as there we have heard) to let us ſee that nothing but our <hi>good deeds</hi> can preſerve us from thoſe evil machinations againſt us.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. It is therefore as for a reward of doing good that Holy Church preſumes to beg <hi>protection from all adverſity</hi> in her childrens way; and, for their better means of doing <hi>good deeds</hi> ſacred <hi>to the holy name of God,</hi> ſhee hath to day drawn them all up into a Body, leaſt the enemy finding any ſtragling ſouldier of this holy Army, fall upon him at a lonely diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.

                        <p>O God our refuge, and ſtrength, be preſent (thou the Authour of all piety) to the godly Prayers of thy Church, and grant that what we ask faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully we may obtain effectually.</p>

                           <p>I Muſt confeſſe that whoſoever caſts his eye upon the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, (taken out of this dayes Goſpel,) and Prayer above, will have ſmall encouragement to think they ſpeak both one ſenſe, and yet we muſt or make them do ſo, or in vain we are come thus far towards the end of our Book, and to fail now were to ſuffer ſhipwrack in our own haven, after the having eſcaped many a ſtorm abroad at Sea. Firſt therefore, let us ſound the depth of the water in this haven, ſee the ſenſe of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:204830:478"/> Prayer; which in the entrance ſteers us right, by bidding us call upon <hi>the Authour of piety, Almighty God, our refuge and ſtrength;</hi> and to petition he will <hi>be preſent to the godly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of holy Church;</hi> and <hi>to grant that what we ask faithfully</hi> (ſincerely, or cordially) <hi>we may obtain effectually,</hi> even to the full of our deſires. This certainly is the ſenſe of the Prayer, and further Gloſſe it needeth not, nor God be thanked need we any more to ſhew it ſpeaks the whole contents both of the Epiſtle, and Goſpel of the day: For ſee how the <hi>trust in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ,</hi> which Saint Paul begins his Epiſtle with to day unto the Philippians, ſpeaks in other terms that which the Prayer calls <hi>refuge;</hi> See how the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of God is that whereby the <hi>good work</hi> of Chriſtianity in <hi>us begun is made perfect,</hi> even <hi>to the repleniſhing of us with the fruits of juſtice by Jeſus Christ</hi> unto the <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>praiſe of God;</hi> as this Epiſtle concludes the Philippians were ſo repleniſhed. But that which yet more peculiarly appropriates this Prayer unto the Epiſtle is the <hi>ſincerity</hi> which Saint Paul hopes will be the effect of their Chriſtian <hi>charity,</hi> and ſuch an effect as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them <hi>without offence unto the day of Chriſt.</hi> And indeed 'tis this <hi>ſincerity</hi> which opens this cabinet of rich connexion to day between all the parts of holy Churches ſervice; ſince it is not to be hoped we ſhall <hi>effectually</hi> obtain any thing that we do not <hi>ſincerely</hi> (for that is here the ſenſe of <hi>faithfully</hi>) petition Almighty God; and conſequently, if onely the want of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> debar us of our hopes, where that <hi>ſincerity</hi> is not wanting there we may hope to ſpeed for all we ask; and this <hi>hope</hi> being given us in the Prayer above renders this Epiſtle moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto the Prayer. As for the Goſpel, if we take the words, and do not mark to what ſenſe they drive at, we may boldly ſay, no Goſpel can be more diſſonant then this below is to the Prayer above. But if we ſee that from the firſt unto the laſt of the Goſpel, there is nothing but a juggle <hi>in the Phariſees to intrap our Saviour in his ſpeeches,</hi> and then ſurpriſe him moſt when they moſt do flatter him with the ſtile of <hi>Master,</hi> of <hi>learned,</hi> of <hi>upright,</hi> of <hi>unpartial, even</hi> unto <hi>Princes,</hi> and the like, when yet at the ſame time we ſee they aimed at nothing
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:204830:479"/> more then to undermine him, and bring him within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of high treaſon; when (I ſay) we ſee this to be the drift of the Goſpel on the Jews part, and that our Saviour, ſeeing the <hi>naughtineſs</hi> of their thoughts, asks them plainly why they play the <hi>hypocrites</hi> with him? then I preſume no man that can tell twenty will marvell to ſee this dayes Prayer beg <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> and <hi>ſincerity</hi> of heart in us Chriſtians at leaſt; when we ſee the Phariſaick Jews are convinced of ſo groſſe an infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and flattery, even when they pretend forſooth a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of conſcience; and when we hear our Saviour recommend the ſame <hi>fidelity</hi> which we petition for to day, in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them <hi>faithfully to render that to Caeſar which is Caeſars,</hi> and <hi>that to God which is Gods;</hi> namely, their pecuniary tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> their religious <hi>ſincerity to God,</hi> and that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they pretend it, (as here the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, though they leaſt intended it.) Let me therefore, beloved, beg it as a boon, that you all ſay this Prayer to day, with ſuch <hi>ſincerity</hi> of heart, as may render it, and you gratefull in God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſight, and hearing; for then ſhall we pray moſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly to what the Church doth preach to day, and then ſhall we be ſure ſuch our petitions will be granted <hi>effectually,</hi> which are made unto God <hi>faithfully;</hi> and this aſſurance we have both from the Epiſtle, Goſpel, and Prayer of this preſent Sunday. A great content I confeſſe, after the fear of ſo great a loſſe as we were like to be at for making good the grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of our work, which as yet comes fairly home when we might fear we had been fartheſt off.</p>

                           <p n="6">6. THe Apoſtle here ſpeaks in the plural Number, becauſe he writes this Epiſtle as well in his companions name as his own, in Timothies; though afterwards (himſelf being onely in Priſon, and not Timothy) he ſpeaks to them in his own perſon, but directs his Epiſtle as from both, to ſhew them, that abſent, or preſent, they are both of one mind. <hi>The work</hi> he confides to have continued is their converſion. By <hi>the day of Christ</hi> he means the day of Judgement, which is that of his ſecond coming, the firſt being his birth-day.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. It is <hi>reaſon</hi> indeed for him to conſide thus, becauſe as their converſion was by means of God his ſpecial grace, ſo he preſumes the ſame goodneſſe of God will be continued which was begun in them; and becauſe he hopes their cooperation will not be wanting to perſevere in the <hi>faith</hi> of Chriſt, as it was not firſt to accept thereof. Hence his charity makes him hope this of them with reaſon, and his faith makes him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the other of God towards them. Yet not ſo that hence the Reformers can infer (as they do) out of this place, that it
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:204830:480"/> is impoſſible for one who is once called by God, and in grace, ever to loſe the ſame grace, or vocation. The Apoſtles words import no ſuch thing; onely a religious hope, or confidence he hath they will indeed perſevere as they have begun, to love, ſerve, and honour Almighty God; as his following words teſtifie in this Verſe, becauſe he profeſſeth here that he prayes continually for their perſeverance, which argues it is not a thing to be hoped, but by endeavours and pains on our parts. Nay, Saint Paul ſo plainly ſpeaks to this ſenſe, that he ſeems to ſay, leaſt their own endeavours towards this perſeverance ſhould not ſuffice, he hath made it even his hearts deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and applies his perſonal ſufferings to this end, that God moved by his prayer, and perſecution may ſupply what is wanting in them towards perſeverance by their own ſole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. And it is Saint Auguſtines, and the Churches do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine indeed, that juſtifying grace alone ſufficeth not toward perſeverance, without new favours of more and more grace do inable us to perſevere. In the cloſe of this verſe the Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to the hope he hath of Martyrdom, for the defence of the faith of Chriſt againſt thoſe who oppoſe it, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it in thoſe who have imbraced it. And this he means by his <hi>joy</hi> whereof he prayes <hi>they may be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="8">8. And that he doth thus pray he <hi>calls God to witneſs,</hi> and doth this with ſuch earneſtneſſe, as if he were not himſelf happy enough to be <hi>in the bowels of Jeſus Christ,</hi> (which is in his boſome in Heaven,) unleſſe he might find theſe Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians there alſo; or as if his love to them, and zeal of their ſalvations were ſuch, that he deſired Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have them equally in his breaſt, or bowels of affection with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Both theſe ſenſes this text will bear very well: as alſo, that by theſe words Saint Paul profeſſeth he loves them ſo tenderly, that he cannot expreſſe it otherwiſe then by ſaying it is even with the affection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, following Chriſt's inſtruction, Joh. 13.34. <hi>Love one another, as I have loved you.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="9">9. Here he prayeth for the ſuperadded grace which above
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:204830:480"/> was ſaid to be neceſſary to perſeverance, which is for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of charity: where that abounds there is wanting nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>knowledge</hi> of what is the true doctrine of the Church of Chriſt, nor what is the true ſenſe, and meaning thereof; ſince by this abundant charity we ſee the ignorant Apoſtles were ſo illuminated, that they could and did penetrate into the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſenſe of the deepeſt myſteries of Chriſtian faith, and religion.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. This alludes to the ſenſe as above in the former Verſe, that by their increaſe in love, and charity they might be able to diſtinguiſh between the Apoſtles Chriſtian, and Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus his Judaical, and others heretical doctrine, as finding that of Chriſtianity the more powerfull, and efficacious to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It ſeems by theſe words, the Apoſtle thinks the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed charity of hereticks is not <hi>ſincere</hi> love, and affection to God, and their Neighbour, but hath a mixture of hypocriſie in it, and makes uſe of the name of Chriſt to cover the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of thoſe who indeed are oppoſite to him, by ſaying, this or that is Chriſt his doctrine which indeed is not ſo, but proves (upon a ſtrict examine) the ſenſe and doctrine of ſome private ſpirit that values it ſelf above others, and ſo to get repute will defend, and ſpread a falſe doctrine under the name of the truth. And truly this S. Paul intimates, while he bids them be <hi>ſincere,</hi> not mixing adulterine with true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for if ſo, they cannot be <hi>without fault,</hi> as he deſires they may prove to have been at the <hi>day of judgement.</hi> Nay, ſo free he wiſheth them from any offence there, as they may be neither guilty of giving, nor taking offence, ſince in true Chriſtianity no man can be hurt but by himſelf, and therefore ſhould not take offence, or be angry at others upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whatſoever; angry he means to ſin.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. But inſtead of being guilty of <hi>offence,</hi> he prayes they may be <hi>repleat</hi> (abundantly filled) <hi>with the fruits of juſtice;</hi> meaning of all virtues whatſoever, ſince every virtue is an act of <hi>juſtice,</hi> taking <hi>juſtice</hi> in the large, and favourable ſenſe, as here the Apoſtle doth; All which acts we are to practice by virtue of our Saviours paſſion, and conſequently as his
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:204830:481"/> paſſion was, ſo muſt our actions be to the honour and <hi>glory of God.</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. SAint Paul in this Epiſtle exhorts the Philippians to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance</hi> in their faith of Chriſt; and that they may perſevere, makes it his inſtant prayer, even when he was ready to lay down his life for confirmation of that Chriſtianity he had brought them to imbrace, and wherein he prayes their <hi>charity may more and more abound,</hi> and teſtifie their <hi>ſincerity</hi> and innocency of life not onely here but <hi>at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. What was then the language of S. Paul to the Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is now the Churches unto us that are Chriſtian Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. O what a ſaintity would that <hi>ſincerity</hi> produce in us, which ſhould carry us on <hi>without offence unto the day of doom!</hi> And yet we are by this Epiſtle here exhorted to be no leſſe <hi>ſincere</hi> in all the actions of our life, then we ſhall be in that where every thought (as well as words and deeds) ſhall be <hi>ſincerely</hi> opened unto all the world: at leaſt beloved if we cannot here be fully ſo <hi>ſincere</hi> as there we muſt and ſhall be, we have another leſſe degree yet of <hi>ſincerity</hi> recommended in this Epiſtle, which may ſuffice to ſaint us here on earth; that which we did profeſſe at holy baptiſme who were never other then Catholicks, that which we did profeſſe at our converſion who were bred otherwiſe, when we ſtood reſolv'd to ſacrifice our lives and fortunes to the perſecutours rather then not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our ſelves to be converted to the Catholick Religion. Yes, yes beloved, this <hi>ſincerity</hi> at leaſt is requiſite the longeſt day we live, ſince there's no leſſe an account to be made at the later doom <hi>of our walking worthy that vocation,</hi> then of our being Catholicks. 'Tis not the name, but the reality, and <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> of the thing we muſt account for then, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now endeavour for. O could this <hi>ſincerity</hi> attend us at our prayers, wait on our words and works, what a ſaintity would it produce in our ſouls both in the ſight of God and man!</p>

                              <pb n="331" facs="tcp:204830:481"/>3. To conclude, what is great part of the guilt of every ſin that lies upon our conſcience but a meer defect of this <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> in our proceedings? Whence holy Church to day prayes in a language preaching nothing elſe to us but this <hi>ſincerity</hi> of ſoul to God and man, when ſhe bids us not hope for what we ask without it, and when ſhe minds us of it in the preamble of her petition, profeſſing God alone <hi>to be our Refuge and our ſtrength,</hi> and thereby cutteth off all hope of other helps then what he muſt afford us: ſo that if we think on what we ſay we needs muſt be <hi>ſincere</hi> in this petition, and cannot hope for help from God towards any thought or deed that is not <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> in order to his honour, in order to our own ſalvation.</p>

AFter Chriſt had told them the <hi>Parable</hi> of the man coming to a wedding feaſt without his nuptial gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Then immediatly the Phariſees conſulted amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves how to intrap him in his ſpeeches.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="16">16. For which purpoſe they ſend him their inſtruments choſen for this purpoſe, men of their own malicious minds: and to make it worſe, they ſend as witneſſes againſt him ſome <hi>Herodians,</hi> men of the family, or retinue of Herod, a great friend of Caeſars, or of the Roman Empire; becauſe their hope was to wreſt out ſomething from him that might be offenſive to Caeſar, and ſo to accuſe him of treaſon. Lo their ſubtle aggreſſe in calling him <hi>Maſter,</hi> whoſe diſciples they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meant to be, but rather ſtudied to make themſelves maſters of his life. By <hi>the way of God,</hi> they mean here the Law which leads men in the way to Heaven: and ſince we look on thee as knowing exactly this Law, and as one that is <hi>ſincere,</hi> and will not diſſemble with us, and art beſides ſo equal to all men as thou art partial to none, nor wilt flatter any one be he never ſo great; for by <hi>respect</hi> here is underſtood onely impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality to all, not neglect to any.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. The reaſon why they asked his opinion in this was, in hope he might (being a Jew) have been infected with the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Judas Galilaeus,</hi> even his own country-man, who taught it was not lawfull for the Jews (that were the choſen people of God) to allow any ſovereignty, or dominion to Princes of the Gentiles; as if whom God had not elected to be his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, (as he did the Jews) they could not pay duty, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to, be they never ſo great Princes: and ſince namely
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:204830:482"/> 
                              <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> was a Gentile, hence they did hope Chriſt would have denied <hi>tribute</hi> to be due unto him, and ſo they would have accuſed him both of hereſie at home, and treaſon abroad.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. Here we ſee Chriſt gives a teſtimony of his Deity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows their thoughts to be malicious, however their words are fawning, and flattering: and therefore that he might follow the exact rule of an anſwerer, he looks upon the intention of the words of the asker; and he tells them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their diſſimulation when he rebukes them, and their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical temptations; for though they flatter to deſtroy him, yet he reprehends to ſave them. And thus we ſee an angry God is more profitable then a propitious man, ſince the one cannot, the other may deceive us, or attempt at leaſt ſo to do, as here theſe people did, even when they made the faireſt ſhew of friendſhip to our Saviour.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. But Chriſt, intending to give them a further check by ſeeming to go yet on towards the ſnares they had laid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap him, calls for a piece of that <hi>coin</hi> which was called the tribute money, being a piece to the value of ſix pence.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. And they giving him one of them, he demands whoſe picture that was which he found ſtamped on the money; not that he who knew their thoughts before could be ignorant whoſe <hi>coin</hi> it was they gave him, but that he was deſirous to give them a convincing anſwer to their capricious queſtion, by taking the ground of his anſwer out of their own mouthes, and <hi>ſo to ſtop their mouthes by confounding</hi> them upon their own words.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. They tell him boldly it was <hi>Caeſars;</hi> namely <hi>Tiberius</hi> his coin, the then Roman Emperour, who had reigned eighteen years, as Saint Luke ſayes, c. 3. v. 1. and was deſcended of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, the firſt who took the name of Caeſar, as all the Roman Emperours did after. Our Saviour hearing them ſay this, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in ſuch ſort as if he had wondred they could doubt of what they asked, ſo be inſtantly replies, (if it be <hi>Caeſars</hi> coin) <hi>Give that to Caeſar which is Caeſars,</hi> or rather ſurrender, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore (ſo <hi>reddite</hi> imports) to your Sovereign the <hi>tribute</hi> of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:204830:483"/> that <hi>coin</hi> which he gives you to repay it to him; for you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not your ſelves (without breach of the law) make your own <hi>coin,</hi> but muſt onely uſe ſuch as your Sovereign ſtamps, and gives you as a token it is his, and not your own, becauſe it bears his picture on it as you ſee. And whereas you asked me this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion with a ſeeming regard to God, as if you would not have him offended by his peoples paying <hi>tribute</hi> to Gentiles; know, God expects the <hi>tribute</hi> of your hearts, and not that of your purſes; open therefore your hearts to God, your purſes to your Princes, ſo ſhall you comply with your duties to both. Not that by this anſwer our Saviour did determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Jews were tyrannically ſubjected to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, for this was a queſtion of ſome intricacy; but that ſince he found themſelves confeſſe the <hi>coin</hi> they had was <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and in uſing it that they did acknowledge themſelves his ſubjects, therefore he bid them <hi>give Caeſar what was Caeſars,</hi> not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the crown but at leaſt the <hi>coin</hi> to be his due. Yet if Chriſt had determined the crown to be Caeſars too, the one hundred years preſcription that the Roman Emperours could pretend unto, by a tacite conſent all that while on the Jews part, might well have avouched that determination, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably our Saviour did ſo conceive, and ſo determine too by this anſwer. Beſides, the queſtion was not ſo much whether they were bound by humane Law, as by divine, for they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pretend conſcience, and to think it might be a ſin to God for a Jew to pay duty to a Gentile; and to this Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers it may be lawfully, and ſafely done in conſcience if a Gentile be their lawfull Sovereign.</p>

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:204830:484"/> that he finds (even among Chriſtians) ſuch grievous <hi>ſinners</hi> as <hi>are enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> ſuch as make <hi>their belly their God,</hi> and for ſo doing have <hi>deſtruction their end, and confuſion their glory:</hi> and ſince he labours to reclaim them, by laying his own life a pattern of ſanctitie before their eyes, beſeeching them to have (as himſelf had) their <hi>converſation in heaven,</hi> to emulate the gifts of glory, expoſed for reward to thoſe that are good Chriſtians; and incouraging them (the Philippians) that were good <hi>to continue</hi> ſo, naming for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the reſt, certain godly matrons, <hi>Euodia, and Syntiche.</hi> But how much more ſutable is the Goſpell to this prayer? wherein we ſee the enormitie of ſinne ſet out by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of <hi>death in Jairus his daughter,</hi> and by the naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a long continued <hi>iſſue of bloud in another woman:</hi> Both which corporall cures the Expoſitours apply unto a ſpirituall cure of all ſinne whatſoever; when they will have the Jewes to be repreſented by the <hi>dead daughter of Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> reſtored to life, and the Gentiles by the <hi>woman cured of her bloudy iſſue;</hi> and conſequently all the bands of ſinne untied, <hi>by the benignitie of God,</hi> which were contracted <hi>through the frailtie of humane nature,</hi> when Chriſt our Lord came to ſhew <hi>mercy,</hi> and give <hi>pardon</hi> not onely to his own choſen people the Jewes, but even to all the Gentiles, to all ſinners how enormous ſoever. Tell me now, beloved, is it not with reaſon Saint Gregory calls the prayers of holy Church <hi>Sacraments,</hi> Myſteries, when they are ſet to the ſame tune that the myſterious Scripture ſings unto the people out of the Preachers mouthes? (for ſuch we may account the Expoſitours of holy Writ to be) And what marvell if we finde the Antiphon (leading the tune to the prayer) to point at the latter of theſe two women, rather then at the former, ſince we have heard this was a Gentile, that a Jew? For hence we that are Gentiles are taught to pray peculiarly for <hi>pardon</hi> of our owne <hi>ſinnes,</hi> moved thereunto eſpecially by <hi>the benignitie of our Lord,</hi> who though he firſt called the Jew,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:204830:485"/> yet he firſt converted the Gentile, becauſe (as this Antiphon tells us) the Gentiles faith was ſtronger then the Jews, and therefore the obſtinate Jew ſhall not be converted, till the latter day, when we are to have onely <hi>one ſhepheard, and one fold of ſheep,</hi> one Chriſtian Church made up both of Jews and Gentiles: and for that reaſon we do not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in the prayer between them, becauſe as it is now onely our prayer to God, ſo hereafter it will be theirs, as well as ours, without putting the Church to the trouble of a new prayer upon that occaſion of increaſing the number of her children. And aſſuredly that happy time will come (with the greater increaſe) if we with fervour ſay this prayer in the mean time; firſt, for the am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="17">17. BE not onely <hi>followers</hi> of my words, but of my actions: for ſo he means by bidding them <hi>walk</hi> (live) as they do, who follow the <hi>form</hi> of his Apoſtolical life and actions. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py inſtructions for the Prieſts to do themſelves, as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort others to do; and in this ſhew they are truly miniſters of the new, not of the old law! whence Chriſt bid the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hear, believe, and obey, but not to do as they did them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that Mat. 23.4. <hi>laid huge burdens on their neighbours ſhoulders, and would not carry the leaſt burden on their own.</hi> Happy ſheep, that had now ſhepherds, who would not onely let them out into the paſtures, but defend them from the wolves, by looſing their lives, rather then expoſe their ſheep to danger! as S. Paul did, who in perſecution gave his flock a pattern of conſtancy, even to the death, rather then he would not follow to a tittle his own <hi>form,</hi> whereby he had taught them born in peace and perſecution how to ſerve God.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. This verſe again argues the Apoſtle reports to good life, as well as to doctrine, when he tells them here many <hi>live</hi> contrary to the <hi>rule</hi> he had framed for them: for though they beleeve rightly, yet they live (<hi>they walke</hi>) awry, they keep not the direct path of perfection, but follow wayes of their own invention, and are to thoſe ſo fondly wedded, that rather then leave their own brainſick imaginations, they will even deny what no reaſon can doubt of. Theſe are Schiſmaticks and Sectaries, of whom the Apoſtle often warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the faithfull, and now (with <hi>teares</hi> in his eyes) moves the Philippians to beware of them again; and tells them, they are ſo far from being Chriſtians, that they <hi>are enemies to Christ,</hi> for ſo he means here by the <hi>Croſſe of Chriſt.</hi> And why <hi>his enemies?</hi> Becauſe they mangle his doctrine in pieces, believing what they liſt thereof, and rejecting what they pleaſe. Of this ſort were in thoſe dayes Simon Magus, who
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:204830:486"/> ſaid Chriſt himſelf went off from the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and onely left his picture hanging there; and Cerinthus, who would needs ſeparate <hi>Jeſus</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and teach that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did indeed truly die and riſe again from the dead, but that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was impaſſible, and ſo went off from the Croſſe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Jeſus</hi> there to die. Thus while they invent fooliſh pieties, they become blaſphemouſly impious; whence it was Saint Paul ſaid, 1 Cor. 2.2. <hi>He knew nothing, but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> to ſhew the fondneſſe of thoſe who would ſeparate <hi>Jeſus</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and deny <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have ſuffered at all: whence he calls theſe <hi>the enemies</hi> not of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> nor of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but of the <hi>Croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> that is, <hi>ſuch</hi> as deny <hi>Christ</hi> to have been really and truely crucified: For beating down of which the Church brought up the uſe of crucifixes erected in all places. And thoſe alſo who make ſuch ſimple imaginations the ground of <hi>Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> Saint Paul calls <hi>enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt;</hi> thoſe who teach auſteritie of life and mortification to be needleſſe, under pretence that <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath ſuffered all puniſhment due for ſinne, and ſo p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="19">19. But ſee the Apoſtles judgement of ſuch <hi>Sectaries,</hi> while he ſayes <hi>their end is destruction:</hi> And that you may know he means the <hi>Libertines</hi> above mentioned, he tells you they are ſuch, whoſe <hi>God is their belly,</hi> who worſhip <hi>Dagon,</hi> not <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who delight in venery and gluttony. But ſee the ſequel of ſuch worldlings; <hi>their glory</hi> (ſayes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,) is <hi>their confuſion;</hi> it ſhall fare with them as with their God Dagon it did, 1 King. 5.4. whoſe head and hands fell from him upon the approach of the Ark, (brought by the Philiſtaeans into the Temple of their God Dagon, while the people reſted themſelves,) leaving this broken-God nothing but the trunk of his body; to ſhew, that the preſervation of his ſordid parts were rather a <hi>confuſion</hi> then a <hi>glory</hi> to them, whileſt the inſtruments of <hi>glory,</hi> the <hi>head</hi> and the <hi>hands,</hi>
                              <pb n="342" facs="tcp:204830:487"/> (betokening glorious reſolutions, and heroick actions) were deſtroyed. And indeed what ſo contemptible, ſo uſeleſſe as a man without hands or head? ſo while Dagon was thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, he had reſerved onely his infamy to be his future <hi>glory;</hi> and this in token the <hi>Libertines</hi> that are his Adorers, can expect no other end then what is infamous, as this. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch miſcreants fear to come near the Chriſtian Ark, the Tabernacle of the holy Altar, leſt they be in the ſight of God at leaſt regarded but as Dagons ignominious Statue before the Ark.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. See how farre S. Paul is removed from thoſe ſordid, thoſe earthly cogitations, when he tells you <hi>his converſation is in heaven,</hi> his thoughts are fixed on Almighty God; and by this means teacheth us, that ours ſhould be ſo too, the <hi>form</hi> or rule of Chriſtianity being to meditate heavenly, not earthly things, and to hope for no good, but what deſcends from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon us: whence we may expect to ſee our <hi>Saviour Jeſus Chriſt</hi> coming to bring us (at the latter day) the ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant reward of all our dayes ſpent here in a holy <hi>converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                           <p n="21">21. And ſee the manner how he will impart this reward, declared in theſe words that follow, by <hi>reforming the body of our humility;</hi> when our abject, vile, and contemptible bodies ſhall become beautifull, noble, and glorious in the ſight of God, by having them <hi>reformed</hi> (transfigured) into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accidentall, not eſſentiall <hi>form;</hi> but remaining ſhaped as now they are, they ſhall of corruptible become incorruptible, of paſſible impaſſible, of earthly celeſtiall, of lumpiſh agile, of dark lightſome; and thus <hi>reformed</hi> or transfigured, they ſhall be <hi>configured</hi> (conformed) alſo to <hi>the body of Christ his glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So immenſely doth he love man, that in requitall of the humane nature which he took of us, we ſhall take, as it were, divine nature from him, while our bodies ſhall by heavenly glory be like to that of Chriſt, which hath its ſplendour not as ours from a created, but as his from an increated glory, by the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:204830:487"/> of his divinity, through the cloud of our humanity; there being no perſonall difference in Chriſt between God and man, however his two natures differ as much, as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth from the Creatour. And how this ineffable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, the Apoſtle tells us in the cloſe of this verſe, namely by that <hi>operation of Chriſt, whereby he is able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things to himſelf.</hi> Happy ſubjection to that power which glories to exalt what it is able to ſubdue, and yet loſeth not the glory of ſubduing death, while it gives eternall life to our dead bodies, and glory to our corruption!</p>
                           <p>Cap. 4. v. 1. It is indeed an apt riſe he takes to incourage the Philippians in this fourth chapter to ſtand firm to his principles, to his rules of good life, which in the former chapter he ſayes he framed for them, when for their ſo doing they ſhall have the reward as above. No marvell he calls them <hi>his dearest,</hi> when he profeſſeth they are <hi>his joy, his crown,</hi> the fruits of his labours, which God will reward with the <hi>joyes</hi> of heaven, and with a <hi>crown</hi> of glory, which ſhall have in it a precious ſtone of ſpeciall beauty, for every ſoul he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: And by this we ſee, beſides the eſſentiall Beatitude, (which conſiſts in ſeeing God) thoſe that are the means of others ſouls ſalvation, ſhall have an accidentall glory given them, as a particular reward due unto them, not onely for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul they have been a means to ſave, but alſo for every good deed wrought by thoſe ſouls, who have followed the examples of Gods Saints: but how that accidentall glory differs from the eſſentiall, is hard to ſay; the words we allow, the things we know not. See how he inculcates here perſeverance in good works. <hi>Stand,</hi> (perſiſt, continue) <hi>my deareſt,</hi> ſayes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as you have begun, and then you make your ſelves and me happy indeed, ſince it is the end that <hi>crowns</hi> the work; ſo to begin well little avails, without you perſevere in well-doing unto the end.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Theſe were two remarkably famous women among the Philippians for ſaintity of life, and for exhorting of people to the ſame by their good examples; ſo the Apoſtle takes ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall notice of them, thereby to incourage them to go on, and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:204830:488"/> others to follow their footſteps: and leſt their difference in the wayes of piety and devotion might make a diviſion of minds in them, he exhorts them to be <hi>of one mind,</hi> to direct their devotions to one end of Gods glory onely, (for that is to be <hi>of one mind in our Lord</hi>) not to affect ſingularity, but ſolidity of devotion, they being otherwiſe free enough from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or diſcord of mind, though ſome impertinently inferre hence, they were at variance.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. It is left by Expoſitours uncertain who this <hi>dear compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> was, though all concurre he was ſome holy man whom alſo S. Paul here exhorts: (as he did holy women before) but ſure enough it is not his wife; though ſome hereticks will have it ſo, yet without all ground, ſince the Apoſtle in another place profeſſeth he was not married, but commends thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſingle; (as himſelf was.) Neither doth it follow, that women in thoſe dayes did preach the Goſpel as well as men, though here the Apoſtle ſayes <hi>Euodia</hi> and <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiche</hi> did <hi>labour with him in the Goſpel,</hi> did ſuffer for their faith, for their belief in Jeſus Chriſt, and for following the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, and did incourage all others to do the like, by harbouring the Apoſtles, and by relieving thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that were in want. O that the Ladies of theſe dayes would give Prieſts occaſion (by following the examples of theſe two Ladies) to record their holy memories, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath done thoſe of theſe two pious women! <hi>Clement</hi> here mentioned, is the ſame who was the fourth Pope, ſucceeding Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, who had Linus for his predeceſſour, that was S. Peters immediate ſucceſſour. The cloſe of this Epiſtle is liable to miſconſtruction; ſome make it the ground of their errour, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that thoſe who are once in grace can never fall from thence, and ſo have <hi>their names written in the book of life:</hi> (are predeſtinate, and cannot chooſe but be ſaved) But this is farre from the genuine ſenſe of the Apoſtle, who had before ſo much inculcated perſeverance in good works, as in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle we have heard: his meaning therefore muſt be, that thoſe who by Baptiſme are firſt adopted children of God, (and by a holy life preſerve their favour in the ſight of God) are at
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:204830:488"/> laſt <hi>written in the book</hi> of glory, as at firſt they were in the <hi>book</hi> of grace; as who ſhould ſay, he did exhort them that were firſt innocents, to be at laſt Saints, and ſo deſerve to be finally inrolled Commanders of the heavenly Militia, after they had been once liſted ſouldiers of the militant Church of Chriſt.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. THe doctrine of <hi>ſincerity</hi> laſt Sunday inculcated, is this day proſecuted by S. Paul to the Philippians; and leſt they ſhould miſunderſtand him, he tells them plainly, he requires as <hi>ſincere</hi> a Chriſtianity in them as they found to be in himſelf, while he makes his own <hi>rule of life</hi> their pattern and example to follow him by; and doth not fear to fright them from their onely nominall Chriſtianity, by declaring thoſe to be <hi>enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt</hi> who do not really &amp; <hi>ſincerely</hi> take up the ſame and carry it, as well as they pretend to do it, who have not <hi>their converſation in heaven,</hi> while they preſume to hope their bodies ſhall go thither, though their ſouls be wallowing here in the mire of fleſh and bloud. Finally, leſt they ſhould be deterr'd from following S. Pauls <hi>Rule,</hi> out of a deſpair of arriving to his perfection in Chriſtianity; (which in thoſe dayes was, and ſtill ſhould be Synonyma with ſaintity) he exhorts them at leaſt to follow the examples of the two virtuous Matrones here ſet before their eyes, <hi>Euodia, and Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiche,</hi> as alſo thoſe of his <hi>ſincere companion,</hi> (though not an Apoſtle) and of the reſt of <hi>his Coadjutors</hi> in the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faith of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Yes, yes beloved, 'tis a holy <hi>ſincerity</hi> that now <hi>our chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> muſt bring along with her to her journeys end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no marvell 'tis two dayes together inculcated by holy Church; nor can there be a greater <hi>ſincerity</hi> then that to day before our eyes, that of the Primitive Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that is it we ſhould endeavour now to have indeed, and not to fain; for as we glory to be Chriſtian Catholicks, ſo we ſhould endeavour to be as <hi>ſincerely</hi> ſuch as they from whom we are deſcended.</p>

                              <pb n="346" facs="tcp:204830:489"/>3. And for as much as holy Church knows rightly well there is no ſaintity on earth free from iniquity, no <hi>ſincerity</hi> that is not waited on by ſome hypocriſie or other; therefore while ſhe preacheth perfection, ſhe prudently prayes for <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> eſpecially now that ſhe draws to the cloſe of her annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all piety, now that ſhe brings <hi>her charity</hi> towards her journeys end, leſt vanity runne away with part of her holy labours. For that is the ſafeſt ſtep to ſaintity which tramples on iniquity, &amp; treads it under foot; thoſe ſtand firmeſt in the grace of God, that are alwayes begging new favours by asking <hi>pardon</hi> for old offences; and they ſhew <hi>ſincerity</hi> of their <hi>love</hi> to God, who deſire to cancell all their obligations to the devil, who are not content with <hi>pardon</hi> for their guilt of ſinne, unleſſe they may be looſened from the <hi>bands</hi> thereof, from their affections un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne. And for as much as <hi>charity</hi> is taught to march out of the field of this life with ſuch a <hi>ſincerity,</hi> with ſuch a <hi>ſincere</hi> deſire of ſaintity, <q>Therefore holy Church brings her towards her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes end now praying for it, as above.</q>

THat is, as <hi>he was</hi> giving a reaſon why his diſciples did not faſt ſo rigorouſly as thoſe of John the Baptiſt did, and as alſo the Phariſees were wont to do, which were onely voluntary and not legall faſts: Then came in this <hi>Governour,</hi> who was a chief officer in the Synagogue called <hi>Jairus,</hi> which ſignifies Illuminatour, or teacher of the people. By <hi>Adoration</hi> is here literally meant falling at Chriſts feet, which yet he did not do before news was brought him by his ſervants, that <hi>now his daughter was dead:</hi> lo then he believes firmly, and in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony thereof proſtrates himſelf, and in the very manner of his language ſaying, <hi>now my daughter is dead,</hi> he blames his not believing and asking help ſooner; but to make amends for his not hoping Chriſt could cure his <hi>ſick</hi> daughter, he invites him to go home, and revive her, though ſhe <hi>now were dead:</hi> not that he doubted but his power at a diſtance would ſuffice, but that he had heard Chriſt was accuſtomed to <hi>touch</hi> thoſe whom he healed in <hi>Capharnaam;</hi> and this was on the ſea coaſt of Galilee, not farre from the ſame town famous for Chriſt his miracles.</p>

                              <pb n="348" facs="tcp:204830:490"/>19. That this is the genuine ſenſe of the verſe above is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the rather, from Chriſt his going immediately to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the cure, even after the ſame manner, namely by a <hi>touch</hi> of his ſacred hand; for we do not hear any rebuke given to <hi>Jairus</hi> for want of Faith, but Chriſt reſting ſatisfied his belief was full, reſolved to give him full ſatisfaction to his Faith and hope, by reviving (as was deſired) his <hi>dead</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, taking his diſciples as witneſſes to this his gracious conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, and working this miracle. Yet this notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Centurions Faith was above this of <hi>Jairus,</hi> who onely asked a word, (ſaying, Mat. 8.8. <hi>ſpeak the word onely</hi>) and held himſelf not worthy the honour of Chriſt his entring his houſe.</p>
                           <p n="20">20 21. 22. Note, this <hi>woman</hi> was a Gentile; and it wants not myſtery to have the <hi>twelve yeares</hi> of her diſeaſes continuation upon her here made mention of, in regard it alludes to the <hi>twelve years</hi> age of <hi>Jairus daughter,</hi> whom Chriſt was going to raiſe from death to life; and thereby gives us to underſtand, Chriſt by his ordaining to do thoſe two miracles at once, would let us know, the dead child being a Jew repreſents the expiration of the Jewiſh Synagogue by the plantation of the Church of Chriſt: For as this diſeaſed Gentile fell ſick, when <hi>Jairus</hi> his child was born; ſo the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles fell to their brutiſh Idolatry, (figured by the Bloudy Flux) when the Jewes were born to right belief in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: and therefore as Chriſt went to raiſe this child from death to life, and by the way firſt healed the diſeaſed <hi>woman;</hi> ſo he came firſt to the Jewes, yet the Gentiles received and believed in him before the Jewes, whoſe converſion (or being raiſed from the death of infidelity to the life of Faith) is not to be till after all Gentiles are firſt reduced, and then at laſt even the Jewes ſhall generally be converted. This is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſenſe of the preſent ſtory proſecuted in theſe three verſes: onely we are to obſerve by this womans <hi>Faith,</hi> that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are of much more eaſie and entire belief then the Jewes: beſides this place gives a great ground for the Catholick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of revering reliques; ſince here the <hi>woman</hi> was cured
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:204830:490"/> by the onely <hi>touch</hi> of our Saviours garments hemm: and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius writes, that ſhe, in memory of this favour ſhewed unto her, made a coat like that of our Saviours, and kept it religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in her houſe, and that diverſe who were diſeaſed went away from her perfectly cured upon the ſole touch of this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hemm alſo.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. 24. The muſick our Saviour found here was onely <hi>ſuch</hi> as uſually in thoſe dayes did accompany all burials. Our Saviours ſaying <hi>the child is not dead,</hi> did not deny but ſhe was ſo, for all that; onely his meaning was, ſhe ſhould live again, and therefore he accounted her death but a <hi>ſleep</hi> in the ſight of God, becauſe her ſoul was not ſummoned to the barre of Judgement, being to return and lead a longer life in this world: though this ſaying of Chriſt might alſo import his modeſty, in not making difficult his works, to get thereby po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applauſe: However they knew, and ſo did Chriſt, the child was really dead to all humane power of recovery, but that they might ſee death to God, was but as ſleep to nature, ſince he that could out of nothing make all things, could much more eaſily out of a dead body make a living creature; and ſo (as to God) <hi>death</hi> and <hi>ſleep</hi> are much alike, in reſpect of privation of life; whence it is frequent for Chriſt to call <hi>death</hi> obdormition, or <hi>ſleeping</hi> onely: thus he did in Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus his caſe, after he was four dayes buried, Joh. 11.44. and thus you ſee here he doth in this preſent caſe of the <hi>dead child.</hi> But as commonly men judge of all things by outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and of other mens powers by comparing them to their own; ſo here theſe mourners laugh at Chriſt for ſaying the <hi>dead</hi> child was onely <hi>aſleep,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, they held it impoſſible for him to revive her; which argues they were ſufficiently ſatisfied ſhe was truly <hi>dead</hi> to all this world.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. 26. Note, his bidding them <hi>depart,</hi> when he ſayes, <hi>ſhe is not dead,</hi> argues that their diffidence in his power did not deſerve the honour to be eye-witneſſes of the miracle, how it was done, though afterwards they had proof enough, it
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:204830:491"/> was moſt true; and again, it argues he was not ſeeking popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applauſe, when he went in alone, leaving the company without, taking onely the child's parents and his diſciples with him: (S. Mark ſayes Peter, James, and John) to ſhew, it was not ultroneous faſting that conferred ſanctity, (of which you heard before) but a lively Faith, and an ardent love to God, wherewith his Apoſtles were endowed, and ſo fit to be now witneſſes of his, and after workers of as great miracles themſelves, though they did not run the vain-glorious wayes of Phariſaical faſting, or the like. Note, the Scripture phraſe is here pathetical, ſaying, Chriſt <hi>held the childs hand;</hi> in ſuch ſort probably as officers take hold of ſuch as they arreſt, to carry away with them, and ſo ſhew their power over them: for thus our Saviour ſeemed to ſnatch the body of this child from death, and to command her ſoul from entring into hell, but to animate again the body; thereby to ſhew, he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect dominion over life and death. And it ſeems the manner of this was extraordinary, when the ſtory of it ends by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was divulged all the countrey over, for a famous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; though St. Mark ſayes, Chriſt gave the girle to her parents, bidding them <hi>ſay nothing,</hi> Mar. 5.43. to ſhew his modeſty, and that he ſought not the worlds applauſe, but onely Gods honour and glory: Yet their diſobedience in this was not unſeemly.</p>

THis Goſpel of the Jewes and Gentiles Infidelity is (as we heard in the Explication) made a whole Type of all Iniquity whatſoever; and yet is moſt peculiarly proper to the Epiſtle inculcating ſo <hi>ſincere</hi> a ſayntity as above: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as to that ſayntity <hi>pardon</hi> of iniquity is neceſſary, and this <hi>pardon</hi> is myſtically repreſented in the raiſing Jairus his daughter from the brink of death, which is the natural puniſhment of ſinne; ſo to the ſaid ſayntity there is alſo
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:204830:491"/> neceſſary a deteſtation of all affection to ſin, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation is alſo repreſented by the cure upon the woman ſick of the <hi>Iſſue of bloud,</hi> not unfitly likened to reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or accuſtomary ſinne, which argues a huge affection thereunto.</p>

                           <p>WE are this day cloſing up the <hi>Ring</hi> of our devotion, which we deſire all the devotes of our <hi>ſodality</hi> to wear, in teſtimony they are of that number, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to holy Davids example, Pſal. 118.109. <hi>have their ſoules alwayes in their hands,</hi> that is to ſay, who make account their every thought, word, or deed ought to be ſuch, as together
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:204830:492"/> with the ſame they are ready to deliver up their very ſouls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of their Creatour; and thoſe ſouls ſo regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as in this <hi>ſodalitie</hi> we are taught, (according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the bleſſed Virgin Mary, Luke 2.19. who <hi>conſerved in her heart every word that fell from the mouth of her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Sonne;</hi>) and as we ſhall then appear <hi>to conſerve</hi> the ſame, when out of the abundance of his holy word lodged in our hearts we make our mouths to ſpeak: and this we do, whileſt all our <hi>prayers</hi> are <hi>abſtracts</hi> of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and all our converſation anſwerable to thoſe <hi>prayers:</hi> (as if we can obſerve the methode of this book, they will be.) And if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, you but look upon the firſt contriver of this devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Saint Gregory the great, you will not undervalue it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had ſo mean a reviver as my ſelf. Know, it was he that called the <hi>Prayers</hi> of holy Church <hi>Myſteries, Sacraments;</hi> and ſurely for this one reaſon, amongſt the reſt, becauſe they did myſteriouſly couch the ſenſe of holy writ, as we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto aſſayed at leaſt to ſhew; and as to day we hope to make it appear, <hi>this prayer</hi> above contains the ſum of both Epiſtle, and Goſpell following; though I confeſſe no ſoul would think it at firſt ſight: for in all the book, there is not any <hi>prayer</hi> which holds a leſſe viſible proportion with the holy Text then this; and yet (if I miſtake not) we ſhall find it comes as home, as heart can wiſh to our deſigne, when once we ſhall reſolve what is meant <hi>by the fruit of the divine work:</hi> (for thats the key to all the treaſure of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion couched in this <hi>prayer.</hi>) What if we ſay that <hi>fruit</hi> is our ſalvation? ſince this is a work ſo truely <hi>divine,</hi> that there is none indeed but God himſelfe can bring forth ſuch a <hi>fruit;</hi> and yet ſo good a God we ſerve, that he is pleaſed we ſhall our ſelves <hi>prepare this fruit,</hi> and ſerve it up unto his heavenly Table; while we are bid pray this day, that (ſince our underſtandings are already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inſtructed in our duties, what they are and ought to be to God) <hi>our wills</hi> may be <hi>ſtirred up</hi> to a performance of thoſe duties, to the <hi>more diligent preparing the fruits of the divine work,</hi> (the ſalvation of our ſoules)
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:204830:493"/> that by redoubled <hi>diligence we may receive the greater reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of God Almighties mercies;</hi> meaning, ſo much of his grace in this life, as may ſecure us of his glory in the life to come: which when with all the <hi>diligence</hi> imaginable we do obtain, 'tis ſtill a <hi>mercy</hi> to us, and muſt be <hi>gratis</hi> given, or elſe we may juſtly fear to go without it: (ſo great a <hi>work</hi> it is to ſave a ſoul!) and therefore well is it called a <hi>work di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi> But what are we the nearer now for adjuſting this <hi>Prayer</hi> unto the Epiſtle and Goſpell of the day? Admit this be the genuine ſenſe of the <hi>Prayer</hi> above, what report hath it to <hi>Judgement,</hi> which is the ſubject of the Goſpel? Why, this at leaſt; that the beſt preparative to ſave a ſoul is to remember the dreadfull day of doome: and therefore when the <hi>Prayer</hi> beggs, to have our <hi>wills</hi> ſtirred up to a more <hi>diligent preparing the fruits of the divine worke,</hi> (the ſalvation of our ſoules) the Goſpell puts us fitly in minde of the day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> ſo to fright us into this <hi>diligence,</hi> leaſt through our ſloth the <hi>Judge</hi> do want that crop of <hi>fruit,</hi> which then he comes to gather. And thus we ſeem to draw a little more neare at leaſt to the end of our deſigne: But if we reade the latter end of the Goſpell, comparing the day of <hi>Judgement</hi> to the ſprouting out of a <hi>figg-tree,</hi> we ſhall come nearer yet; and if we hearken to the Expoſitours upon the 32 and 33 verſes of this Goſpell, how ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they expound that <hi>Parable,</hi> we ſhall then come fully home to the ſweeteſt harmonie imaginable between the Goſpell and the <hi>Prayer.</hi> And for the Epiſtle it is nothing elſe but an exhortation of Saint Paul to the Coloſſians (and in them to us) how to <hi>prepare</hi> our ſoules to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in the very language of the <hi>Prayer,</hi> for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how to <hi>fructifie in all good works,</hi> that we may at the latter day of doome (whereof the Goſpell minds us now) be made worthie to <hi>partake of the lot of Saints, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the power of darkeneſſe, and tranſlated into the Kingdome of the Sonne of Love, in whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, the remiſſion of ſinnes;</hi> in a word, the ſalvation of our ſoules, or the <hi>ripening</hi> of that fruit which we muſt
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:204830:493"/> with all <hi>diligence prepare</hi> for the heavenly Table, as bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>worke</hi> of our heavenly Lord. When (I ſay) we doe conſider this, then we ſhall need no more to ſeek for a connexion between the preaching and the <hi>Prayer</hi> of holy Church to day in this period of our work, wherein we were almoſt at a loſſe, even now that we ſtood in greateſt need of making good our whole deſigne, in the cloſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And who can marvell now that this ſweet <hi>Prayer</hi> ſhould be ſuitable to the ſower day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> when we ſee that dreadfull ſtory in the Goſpell cloſed up with the gladſome <hi>Parable of a fruitfull Spring?</hi> And why? to ſhew that to the Bleſſed, the day of doome is a time o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> Joy, and that the juſt alone are of conſideration with Almightie God. In a word, pleaſe but to reade the Expoſitours upon that point, (as in the gloſſe below you find them) and tell me then, whether <hi>this Prayer</hi> doe want connexion unto that gloſſe of theirs? if not, then you will grant the <hi>Prayers</hi> of holy Church to be (as Saint Gregory calls them) <hi>Sacraments,</hi> myſteries indeed of Pietie, but ſuch, as when explained, are ſweet as honey, and facile as we can deſire: For what more eaſie now, then to ſee this <hi>Prayer</hi> alludes to <hi>Judgement,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that holy Church deſires her children ſhould be ready for it; that is, to be <hi>prepared fruit</hi> for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Table; and by that <hi>preparation</hi> to be <hi>worthie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the greater remedies of God Almighties mercies</hi> at the day of <hi>Judgement</hi> againſt the corruption of humane nature, namely, his gifts of glory added to thoſe of grace? And thus we ſhall cloſe up the Ring of our devotion, with the ſame Chriſtian dutie we began it, whileſt, mindfull of the day of doome, we pray <hi>our wills may be raiſed</hi> up to an alacritie in our Chriſtian dutie, as they were by the ſame ſpirit of <hi>Prayer</hi> raiſed upon the ſame ſubject on the firſt Sunday of Advent, which this foure and twentieth Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day after Pentecoſt inclines unto, in like manner as all parts of a circle bow to meet each other with a plie to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularitie; and ſo the dutie of a Chriſtian is then beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when (having once begun to ſerve God well) the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:204830:494"/> whole continuance of endeavours is ſtill to better that begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſtill to begin anew, where laſt we did end; (as in this work you ſee we doe) ſetting the ſame <hi>feare of our Lord</hi> before our eyes in the end thereof, the ſame memory of the day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> wherewith we firſt begun this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Pietie; which here I tender unto every one of our <hi>ſodalitie,</hi> not doubting but if we live an hundred yeares, we ſhall find of this devotion, that it will alwayes pleaſe though a hundred times repeated over; becauſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is ſo ſweet, as the more we ſuck, it comes the ſweeter ſtill. And ſince in the Title of this Booke we called it not onely a <hi>Chriſtian ſodalitie,</hi> but <hi>a Hive of Bees,</hi> I beſeech God, we may find no <hi>drones</hi> amongſt us in this <hi>Hive,</hi> no lazy <hi>Bees,</hi> that will not flie abroad to ſuck the <hi>hony</hi> of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>from the bloſſomes of the word of God,</hi> which are grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every leaf of this Book, the whole being framed either of the holy Text, or of the Expoſition of the ſame.</p>

                           <p n="9">9. THat is, <hi>from the day we heard</hi> you were converted to the faith of Chriſt, upon the hope you had of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thereby, as in the precedent verſes of this chapter is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and as ſoon as Epaphras our fellow labourer in the vineyard of Chriſt brought us this happy news, and of your ſpeciall love to me and Timothy; From that time <hi>we ceaſe not praying</hi> for your being <hi>ſtill filled</hi> more and more with the grace of God, and with <hi>the knowledge of his will,</hi> (with the acknowledgement thereof) as being done in you by
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:204830:495"/> this your converſion. The Apoſtle appoſitely mentions here <hi>wiſdome and ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="10">10. And praying further, <hi>that you may walk worthy of God in all things pleaſing,</hi> that you may ſo farre pleaſe God in all you do, as to make your ſelves <hi>worthy of him,</hi> by receiving no leſſe then himſelf for your reward of ſo <hi>walking.</hi> By which we ſee, S. Paul here piouſly points at the now Catholick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which the pretended Reformers oppoſe, of meriting hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by our <hi>good works,</hi> (though perhaps this place doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly prove it,) ſince he ſpeaks of making our ſelves <hi>worthy even of God himſelf;</hi> whereas there be thoſe who teach, we are onely imputatively, and not really or <hi>de condigno</hi> juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſts merits, or made partakers of them. Again, leſt he ſhould in vain bid us do what he thought ſufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us thus <hi>worthy,</hi> he tells us in the following words how to be made ſo, namely, by <hi>fructifying in all good works,</hi> by reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit out of every laudable exerciſe, (and others we muſt not addict our ſelves unto) and by <hi>increaſing in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God,</hi> by making it our ſtudy better to underſtand the myſteries of our faith and religion, for thereby it is we come to know God. See here the obligation we have to be daily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in learning more and more of Chriſtianity, and not to loſe our time in ſtudying fooleries, for thereby we ſhall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the <hi>deſerving</hi> Hell, and not <hi>God</hi> for our reward.</p>

And <hi>to thank God the Father</hi> for the benefit of his grace, which gives them that alacrity: he directs our thoughts <hi>to the Father,</hi> as knowing they will thereby be more pleaſing to his ſonne our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who made offering of all his own actions to his heavenly <hi>Father,</hi> thereby to ſhew us we muſt attribute more to the goodneſſe of God, then even to the paſſion of Chriſt, which was dignified from the Deity whereunto the humanity was united. <hi>That hath made us worthy,</hi> this ſhews how little we ought to confide in our own merits, ſince even all the good we do is by the ſpeciall grace of God, and muſt have its value from God aſſiſting, more then from our ſelves acting; yet by both together we become <hi>worthy</hi> of God himſelf for our reward, as was ſaid above, much more of our ſhare with the Saints in glory: though here the Apoſtle alludes chiefly to the Coloſſians being made <hi>worthy</hi> with other Saints of the <hi>light</hi> and glory of the Goſpel by their converſion to the faith of Chriſt; which he calls therefore <hi>the lot of the Saints,</hi> becauſe it is a grace <hi>gratis</hi> given, and no man can me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit his converſion, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>the lot of the Saints</hi> in <hi>the light</hi> of the Goſpel, given by God the father <hi>gratis,</hi> through the merits of our Saviours paſſion. Or if we ſhall take the complete ſenſe of this verſe, it imports, <hi>the lot</hi> we have to ſhare with thoſe who live in <hi>the light</hi> of the Goſpel, is the beginning of the accompliſhment of that <hi>lot,</hi> when we ſhall live and reign with Chriſt and <hi>his Saints in the lot</hi> or happineſſe they have to dwell in <hi>the light</hi> of eternall glory.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. By <hi>the power of darkneſſe</hi> is here underſtood the infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they were in before converſion, when they were under the command of the <hi>Prince of darkneſſe,</hi> as being then in his <hi>power.</hi> By this Graeciſme, or phraſe common among the Greeks, viz. <hi>the Sonne of his love,</hi> is here underſtood his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sonne, the ſecond perſon of the Bleſſed Trinity: not that (as Sabellius would have it) Chriſt was one and the ſame perſon with the holy Ghoſt, proceeding, as he did, by an act of love; whereas we are taught the ſecond perſon was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of his eternall Father, and the third (as ſome Divines hold) proceeded by an Act of mutuall <hi>love</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. BLeſſed S. Paul! we have thee now in half a word; the Coloſſians were as dear to thee as the Epheſians, the Romans, and all thy other Converts: what thou didſt write to one upon the news of their converſion by thy preaching, thou doſt in other terms, but in the ſame ſpirit write to all the reſt. Again, we know our holy mother the Church reads thy ancient leſſons every day anew to us, that we her children may be Chriſtian Catholicks like thy happy Converts: And to that purpoſe ſhe brings <hi>our charity</hi> to day with thy Epiſtle home to her annuall journeys end, as the beſt uſher to lead her to this lifes end alſo, and to the entrance into everlaſting life, that of eternall happineſſe and glory.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. See how to day our holy Mother ſets us all a preaching to our ſelves to this effect, while ſhe doth make us pray to God that he will raiſe up our affections to our own ſalvations. Why Bleſſed Jeſu? is it come to that? muſt we be courted to our own felicity? can we be leſſe then willing to be ſav'd? I dare not ſay it, but I doubt it much: And therefore holy Church I ſee petitions it, leſt we ſhould vainly think we had advanced
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:204830:496"/> farre, when God Almighty knows the many years that paſſe upon our heads are like ſo many labours loſt; and therefore at the end of every year 'tis piety to think we do but then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to wiſh we were but willing to be ſav'd; yet we muſt wiſh it faithfully, <hi>ſincerely,</hi> earneſtly; and we muſt pray withall, that God will graciouſly pleaſe to raiſe our wiſh to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a will at laſt; that if we value not our ſelves, we will not undervalue God Almighty, who looks upon us as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his eyes, as the <hi>fruits</hi> of all his labours, in creating, preſerving, and governing the world and us, in redeeming and ſaintifying of us, for no other end but to ſave us at the laſt; and that at ſo eaſie a rate as can be poſſible, our onely coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with him to that happy end, our onely being willing be ſhould work in us that ſaintity we cannot work in our ſelves without him.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To conclude, the many books of controverſie in the point of merit may be ſumm'd up all in this petition of the Churches Prayer to day; ſo deep, ſo copious, ſo facund, and ſo fecund withall is the ſpirit of the Holy Ghoſt, couch'd in thoſe <hi>teaching Prayers.</hi> What is it elſe we ſay defending merit, but that we muſt cooperate to our ſalvation; but that the more we do cooperate the greater Saints we are; but that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement we make of one grace procures us another greater then the former; but that we ſo take in hand the work of our ſalvation, as we do not think it is, nor can be any work of ours, but muſt be ſtill the work of God in us, (though by us too) whoſe onely part is to be pulling down <hi>the greater remedies of his Piety towards us</hi> by improving his leſſer, and to be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him grace upon grace ſo faſt, untill (by means thereof) we render our ſelves a <hi>fruit of the work divine,</hi> as ripe as grace can make us here, &amp; ready then to be tranſplanted into heaven, where yet the ſunne of glory will mature us more, ſo farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as we ſhall never fear to be corrupted, but ſhall hang upon the tree of everlaſting life, an ornament to the celeſtiall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe?</p>
                           <q>Say now the Prayer above, and ſee how home it is to this conſtruction in it ſelf, to this inſtruction of us by it, if we ſay it in the ſenſe above.</q>

                           <p n="15">15. BY this <hi>Abomination of deſolation</hi> Chriſt meant a moſt abominable deſolation; and moſt probably he allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that which was to follow, namely, the Romans ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeruſalem, as a puniſhment upon the Jewes for having there crucified the Saviour of the world: how horrid and dreadful an <hi>abomination</hi> that was <hi>Joſephus</hi> his hiſtory beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth. But myſtically we may well interpret this <hi>abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be the ſacrilegious defiling of the Temple of Solomon, both by the barbarous murders therein committed by the Jews, and the profaning the Altars thereof by the wicked Prieſts: much more is this <hi>abominable,</hi> when Chriſtian Prieſts profane their holy Altars, and become wicked, Iſa. 24.2. <hi>as the people, ſo the Prieſt</hi> of holy Church. And the like <hi>abomination</hi> it is to receive the body of Chriſt into a ſinfull ſoul; for then he is rather betrayed into the houſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, then received into the Temple of the holy Ghoſt. Not unaptly alſo this <hi>abomination</hi> may allude to Antichriſt, ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf upon the Altars of the Churches to be adored as God. In fine, when any of theſe horrid iniquities are done, then we may piouſly imagine the Judgement of God is not far of; ſince were it not for his mercy ſake, theſe <hi>abominations</hi> deſerved immediate damnation.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. By this verſe is myſtically meant, that when good men ſee theſe enormities done commonly in the cities, they ſhould <hi>flye</hi> from ſuch evil cohabitations, leſt the houſes of the city fall upon their heads, and run out up to the <hi>mountains,</hi> thereby to ſhew they are deſirous of getting up as near to heaven, as may be, when their houſes become a hell unto them: Though literally our Saviour alludes to the advice he after (by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) gave the Chriſtians, when Jeruſalem was to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>to flye from Jurie to the mountains</hi> beyond Judea; (for
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:204830:498"/> the Roman forces had poſſeſſed thoſe hills about Judea) whereas the Jewes hearing of the Romans approaching into their countrey fled all into Jeruſalem; God ſo ordaining it for their deſtruction, who yet thought they ſhould in that famous city be moſt ſafe.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. They were bid flye from <hi>the tops of houſes,</hi> if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be there when the newes came of Titus with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans falling upon them, to ſhew, thoſe powers were to come like a tyde or torrent upon the Jewes unavoidably: and therefore, ſince in thoſe daies their <hi>houſes</hi> were commonly built flat on the top, and their uſe was to eat, and walk there as freely as now men do in lower rooms, they were adviſed to make no ſtay for getting any goods away, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to run, and think themſelves happy if they could ſave but their own perſons: inſomuch that the ſudden deſtruction of Jeruſalem is by the Hiſtorian deſcribed like to Noes floud, to the burning of Sodome with fire from heaven, and to the drowning Pharaoh his forces in the red Sea.</p>
                           <p n="18">18. This verſe followes the ſtrain of the former, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing immediate flight without regard to any thing elſe.</p>
                           <p n="19">19. This expreſſeth their danger, who by the reaſon of children either in their wombs, or at their breaſts, could not make ſpeed enough to ſave themſelves, in regard of their burdens retarding their flight: Alſo it alludes to the ſeverity of Gods wrath over the Jewiſh Nation, who, to puniſh their ſins, would not ſpare the innocent infants of that race, but leave all a prey to the devouring ſword of the Romans, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their mothers bellies, or nurſes laps.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. This ſhewes, the clogg of <hi>winter</hi> wayes and weather forbids (eſpecially to aged men) a ſpeedy flight, ſuch as was neceſſary to avoid this inſtantaneous <hi>deſtruction:</hi> and the Jewiſh Law forbidding any man to walk above a mile (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed half a mile) on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> ſhewes that ſlow <hi>flight</hi> was inconſiſtent with this ſpeedy danger: for though Chriſt did abrogate the rigour of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Law, yet be alludes here to the Jewes and Judaizing Chriſtians, that were hardly
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:204830:499"/> brought off from the ſuperſtitions of their old Traditions. Again, Chriſt here inſinuates it is vain to flye on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> becauſe Jeruſalem (and ſo all) was taken on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="21">21. There is no doubt but the deſtruction of Jeruſalem was a calamity unparallel'd; for ſince Almighty God (in revenge of his ſacred Sons being butthered therein) had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned this city to exemplary puniſhment, he was reſolved to make the rigour of it ſuch, as reſembled rather Hell then any horrour leſſe: onely note, that here it is meant the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſtruction of the Jewes is unparallel'd by any particular nations deſtruction; not that the finall day of Judgement ſhall be leſſe calamitous to all the world, then this day was to the Jewes alone.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. This place literally alludes to the Jewes, as the choſen people of God, and ſo valued by him above all others, that he ſeems to ſay, if they be ſafe, none elſe are in danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe them chiefly he deſires to preſerve; yet ſeeing they will not be gained by him, he then converts his love to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: and in this ſenſe he goes on; meaning, unleſſe the daies of the Jewes ſubverſion by the Romans <hi>had been ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no fleſh</hi> (no Jew) in all the world <hi>ſhould be ſaved, but for the elect,</hi> for ſome very few converted Jews before, for ſome in this confuſion of their overthrow, and for others reſerved for converſion in the latter daies to make one Church, as alſo for reſpect to many Chriſtians amongſt them, God ordained that Titus the Commander ſhould put a limit to the fury of the ſword, and after a time ſhould give quarter even to the Jews, inſomuch that (as Joſephus writes) fourty thouſand of them by the mercy of Titus were ſaved; and but for this, not one Jew in all the world either would or could have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſword, ſo inveterate was the hatred of the Romans to that perſidious Nation: Hence we ſee the power of even a little virtue in man, how great a ſway it bears with God, that for never ſo little good he averts a huge deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. Many conceive Chriſt here paſſeth from his report
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:204830:499"/> to the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and falls on the day of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Judgement: but it is not ſo; for by the word <hi>then</hi> he profeſſeth to continue his former ſenſe: and this ſuites well; for <hi>then</hi> the Jews knowing the time of the Meſſias to be at hand, to ſave themſelves, and to flatter ſuch as uſurped the properties of the Meſſias, they (when perſecuted by one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) would flye to this other, that adhered to ſuch impoſtours as then boaſted themſelves to be the Meſſias: ſo our Saviour, to prevent danger to ſuch as might be carried by this meanes to infidelity, foretels them what arts would be uſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare them. And there were three eminent men of this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faction, <hi>Eleazar the ſon of Simon, Jehu the ſon of Leviah,</hi> and <hi>Simon the ſon of Goriah,</hi> each of theſe ſtrove to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the Meſſias; to theſe therefore and their flatterers this verſe alludes, for theſe would be called Chriſt, as the true Meſſias was.</p>
                           <p n="24">24. See how this verſe verifies the ſenſe of the former; for of theſe and ſuch like men, even of Arch-hereticks in future times alſo our Saviour ſpeaks here: and ſuch were <hi>David George,</hi> and <hi>John of Leyden,</hi> (King of the Anabaptiſts) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming himſelf to be Chriſt, and ſending about his twelve Apoſtles, till he was taken in Weſtphalia, and burnt alive for his abominable hereſie. The <hi>ſignes</hi> here mentioned ſhall be thoſe of witchcraft, and other cheats to delude the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people; as Simon Magus by theſe arts cheated Nero and other Romans, till by S. Peters interceſſion he was brought down from the high pitch of his artificial wings, and daſhed his feet in pieces, to ſhew, Gods Saints are above the devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, ſince by St. Peters prayer he was made unable to go, who by fraud pretended a power to flye. When he ſayes by theſe arts <hi>the Elect ſhall (if poſſible) erre,</hi> he meanes it is not poſſible, morally ſpeaking, that when God pleaſeth to aſſiſt his choſen people, any fraud of the devil himſelf can delude them; though in a phyſical ſenſe there is no impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility thereof, ſince even grace notwithſtanding, men have phyſical power to ſin: yet ſuppoſing God have predeſtinated any to ſalvation, then that may ſtand with infallibility by
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:204830:500"/> ſuppoſition, which abſolutely ſpeaking would not do ſo. Note, the Reformers fondly obtrude this practiſe to us, by expoſing the B. Sacrament to adoration; ſince therein we expoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an inviſible Deity, whereas here our Saviour beats down the expoſing any viſible God in mans ſhape, any to be Chriſt but himſelf: and that he left himſelf thus to be adored till the worlds end we have it avouched from the Apoſtles, who did practiſe, and preach this duty to be done to the B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. He means his prediction to after ages, as well as that to the Jewes of their impoſtures; ſo this warning ſerves us to beware of hereſies and their divulgers.</p>
                           <p n="26">26. Chriſt here alludes to <hi>Simon Geraſenus ſon of Goriah,</hi> who went into the <hi>deſert</hi> and mountains, raiſing forces, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence he would (as the Meſſias) vindicate the injuries done to the Jewes by the Romans: the like did <hi>Eleazar</hi> above men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ioned, and <hi>John,</hi> leaders of the Zelotes; onely they pretended in caves, and vaults, and chambers to ſupply the open worſhips due unto them in Churches, and this with promiſe to reſtore them, as by the Meſſias they did hope to be reſtored, and thought their Captaines to be indeed Meſſias.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. No the true Meſſias comes not thus couched, but his coming ſhall be as viſible, as undoubted, as the <hi>lightening</hi> breaking <hi>in the East,</hi> and <hi>ſeen even to the West:</hi> here indeed he alludes to his ſecond coming in the latter day, when the world ſhall be all on fire <hi>from Eaſt to Weſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="28">28. This he likens to be as ſudden upon men, as the <hi>Eagle</hi> is upon her prey: and though ſome think he onely means the noble <hi>Eagles,</hi> that feed not on dead food, but on living; yet his words incline to the vulturine <hi>Eagle,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and tells us he feeds on dead bodies, and diſcovering them by the ſmell, is as ſoon upon them, as if he ſee them preſently. Chriſt ſeemeth to humble himſelf to this ſort of <hi>Eagles,</hi> both in regard of his own body, which was dead to purchaſe mans life; and in regard it ſuites better with our corruption, which at the latter day is the prey of this <hi>Eagle
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:204830:500"/> Christ Jeſus,</hi> who comes as fiercely upon all mankind (then corrupted in their graves, when ſummoned to Judgment,) as the <hi>Eagle</hi> doth upon his prey, that lives by carrion; to ſhew us, there is then no hope of mercy if we prove corrupted car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, but we muſt be delivered over as a prey to the devouring <hi>Eagle,</hi> meaning the Judge, converting corruptible into incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible fleſh, their unſavoury bodies into ſweet incenſe, to burn (and never be conſumed, nor tormented) before his ſacred Deity.</p>
                           <p n="29">29. See how he falls from the particular devaſtation of the Jewes to the general deſtruction of the whole world, telling us hence forward the ſignes of this, as he did before the ſigns of the other; favouring in a ſort the errour of the Apoſtles, who did believe by his ſpeech the day of Judgement ſhould follow immediately after the deſtruction of Jeruſalem: though indeed he ſpeaks thus to terrifie men from ſin, who after it may immediately fear Judgment; and to ſhew, that what to us is long a coming, to God is ever preſent: ſo he falls out of the one into the other, as if they were both linked together. <hi>The Sun ſhall be darkened,</hi> by which he meanes there ſhall be prodigious Eclipſes before this diſmal day, and ſtrange inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of vapours, to ſhew the dark effect of the child of darkneſſe, ſin. <hi>The Moon,</hi> having no <hi>light</hi> but from the <hi>Sun,</hi> can <hi>give</hi> none when the Suns light is not ſeen. <hi>The Starres</hi> ſhall ſeem <hi>to fall,</hi> but cannot do ſo, for each one is bigger then the earth; yet what with comets playing in the ayr, what with the dazzeling of our eyes in that circumſtance, the ſtarres ſhall ſeem to fall upon us. Myſtically underſtand by <hi>Sun, Moon, and Starres failing</hi> here, the fall of greater and leſſer lights in holy Church by the terrour of the perſecution of Antichriſt at this time: by the <hi>virtues of the heavens</hi> being <hi>moved,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their uſual influence into the creatures of the earth to be diſturbed; yet ſome others think, the very Angels, the movers of the heavens, (and ſo called <hi>their virtues</hi>) ſhall be, as it were, afraid they do fail in their offices, ſeeing the uſual courſe of nature inverted, which may ſeem even to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their conſtant and unmoveable natures; not that indeed

                           <p n="30">30. This <hi>ſign</hi> all allow to be the <hi>Croſſe</hi> of Chriſt, which for three cauſes ſhall then appear; firſt to ſhew Chriſt came to the glory of being Judge over all the world by his former ignominy upon the <hi>Croſſe;</hi> ſecondly, to ſhew, he was truly crucified on the <hi>Croſſe</hi> for all mens redemption, and therefore brings it now to confound thoſe who were ungrateful for ſuch a benefit, eſpecially the Jewes; thirdly, to ſhew that all who were religious worſhippers of him, and of his holy Croſſe, ſhould now march under the banner of it into the Kingdome of heaven: whence it is probable, the very ſelf-ſame Croſſe that Chriſt dyed upon ſhall be then made up, and placed there: (a thing not harder then for the dead to riſe.) By <hi>the bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all tribes</hi> underſtand, that ſome of all tribes ſhall be in a bewailing caſe for their inevi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>able miſery then laid before their eyes: By <hi>the ſon of man</hi> is underſtood Chriſt Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, coming (after his ſacred banner is diſplayed) in the clouds, for three reaſons; firſt, to moderate the infinite ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his glory; next, becauſe a cloud is a type of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den myſtery of his Deity; laſtly, becauſe he ſhall have his judiciary Throne placed in a cloud, wrought out into the form of a moving chariot, ſo that a cloud ſhall be both his ſeat and his footſtool, whileſt in the ayr he appears to all the world below on his Throne of Judgement. He ſhall then come in <hi>great power,</hi> to ſhew, he could have done ſo too when he came a weakling, and alone into the world at his Nativity. In <hi>great Majeſty,</hi> by the attendance of all the quires of Angels, and bleſſed Saints waiting upon him.</p>
                           <p n="31">31. This verſe doth not keep the order of Judgment, but tells the manner: True it is this ſhall be, but not after Chriſt hath appeared, for it ſhall be done before that, and many other of theſe ſigns; ſo it is put in here, leſt the ſtory ſhould come ſhort of truth, not to obſerve the order of the paſſage. This <hi>gathering</hi> of <hi>the elect from all corners</hi> of the world, and from heaven it ſelf, even the higheſt and loweſt ſaints there, argues the care God hath of them, and that no diſtance of place can hinder them from coming to him, who ſends his <hi>Angels</hi> to
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:204830:501"/> bring them for their reward: it tells us alſo, we need not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim our own good deeds, God ſees them, be they done and kept never ſo ſecret to avoid vain-glory.</p>
                           <p n="32">32. What was literally ſaid before, is now anagogically proſecuted, by the example of a <hi>fig-tree,</hi> which never ſprings, but when the heat is ſtrong, that ſo the fruit thereof may be ſecurely ripened, and not nipt with cold, and becauſe it is a <hi>tree</hi> bearing great ſtore of fruit: ſo the Sun of Juſtice appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the earth yields up all her <hi>fruits,</hi> all the Saints thereof, and preſents them to the Sun that muſt mature them for the table of his heavenly Father, when the ſummer of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection comes.</p>
                           <p n="33">33. This example he uſeth to ſhew, that however Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be terrible to thoſe that are in ſin, yet to the juſt, and to God himſelf it is as welcome, as the harveſt which brings in the treaſure of the year, and the fruit of time into the barnes of Eternity. And that we may be frighted from ſin, we are foretold many of the calamities we ſee in all ages, are like ſome of theſe fore-running ſignes to the latter day; ſo we may religiouſly fear our particular Judgement at leaſt is at hand, and when all the ſignes are fulfilled, we may be as ſure the general will follow, as we are ſure the ripening Sun is near, when the <hi>fig-tree</hi> ſends out her ſap from her wary root; or myſtically thus, when in the cold winter of Antichriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, we ſee the Saints (the ſpiritual <hi>fig-trees</hi> of holy Church) put forth with confidence their leaves and buds of ſanctity, we may reſt aſſured thoſe wiſe <hi>figge-trees</hi> are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and then it is time for ſinful fools to repent themſelves, leſt (if not then) it be too late for ever ſo to do.</p>
                           <p n="34">34. This verſe onely imports, that before the end of this world theſe ſigns ſhall be ſeen, and this Judgement ſhall be unavoydable to <hi>mankind,</hi> for that is it he means by <hi>this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:204830:502"/> they ſhall all be eas'd of their obedience to the diſobeying man they are made <hi>ſubject</hi> to, and when they ſhall be ſet to a new ſeries, and frame again, to be ever conſiſtent in their ſeverall degrees of perfection, without viciſſitudes of fading to re-flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: thoſe alterations were their puniſhments for mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication, and for working corruption in his body, who by ſinne had corrupted his own ſoul. <hi>Judgement</hi> is therefore the longing of the juſt, to ſee that juſtice done at laſt which is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd ſo long. And indeed all preſent chaſtiſement is mercy in compariſon of that finall puniſhment, which is therefore eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, becauſe the wicked are unalterable in their malice, and ſo force a rigorous judgement from the bowels of a mercifull Judge.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To conclude, what other ſenſe can holy Church have of this latter day, when at the preaching on that frightfull Text ſhe makes us ſuch a comfortable <hi>prayer,</hi> as bids us beg <hi>tho greater remedies of Gods piety</hi> then, his continuall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the gifts of his glory at the day of Judgement, to candy the confections of his graces, to embalm the bodies of his Saints, and make them uncorrupt as are their ſouls? And all this favour ſhe confidently bids us ask in recompence onely of our willingneſſe to ripen our ſelves in the Sunne of his holy grace, that he may make us <hi>fruits</hi> of eternall glory, and by our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating with him, give us the rewards of his own operations in us; whom he makes labour in his vineyard here a while, that he may ſet us in eternall reſt at his own heavenly table: where though he be pleaſed to delight in us, yet we ſhall be the onely gainers, by enjoying him; for he gets nothing but to be content that we get all, by being but <hi>willing</hi> to preſent our ſelves to him as the humane ſubjects wherein he is pleas'd to produce the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine work</hi> of our ſalvations, while he is ſatisfi'd to call us his <hi>fruit,</hi> that he may be our food for all eternity.</p>
                           <q>Thus we are taught in the prayer above, and may, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with the ſame ſpirit that made it, ſaint our ſelves, as is deſir'd we ſhould by the holy Ghoſt, who gave us this ſainting <hi>prayer</hi> for that holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</q>
